  What's Actually There

  Core Philosophy Documents (~1,500 lines):
  - CLAUDE.md (227 lines) - Instructions for Claude Code when working in this repo
  - AGENTS.md (722 lines) - Project guidelines, code style, design patterns
  - DISCOVERIES.md (212 lines) - Hard-won lessons from debugging and development
  - IMPLEMENTATION_PHILOSOPHY.md (305 lines) - Ruthless simplicity, minimalism principles
  - MODULAR_DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY.md (20 lines) - "Bricks and studs" architecture

  Extended Documentation (~600KB):
  - ai_context/ - 31 markdown files with Claude Code SDK docs, examples, patterns
  - ai_context/claude_code/ - Complete reference for Claude Code features
  - .claude/agents/ - 24 specialized agent definitions

  Total: ~2,000+ lines of philosophy/guidance + extensive reference documentation

  What Each Document Actually Does

  1. CLAUDE.md - "How Claude Code Should Work Here"

  What it contains:
  # Critical Operating Principles
  - Always think through a plan
  - Use TodoWrite for task tracking
  - Delegate to specialized agents
  - Ask clarifying questions
  - Parallelize tool calls

  # Parallel Execution Strategy
  [Detailed patterns for when/how to run things in parallel]

  # Sub-Agent Optimization Strategy
  [When to use which agent]

  # Document Reference Protocol
  [Always check references, re-read sources]

  What it's trying to do:
  Configure Claude Code's behavior to match your workflow preferences.

  Does it actually work?
  Partially. Claude Code reads these files, but:
  - ✅ Instructions like "use TodoWrite" get followed
  - ✅ Philosophy references get incorporated
  - ❌ Complex multi-step workflows sometimes get missed
  - ❌ "Always do X" instructions aren't foolproof

  2. AGENTS.md - "Project Standards & Patterns"

  What it contains:
  # Sub-Agent Optimization Strategy
  # Incremental Processing Pattern
  # Partial Failure Handling Pattern
  # Decision Tracking System
  # Configuration Management: Single Source of Truth
  # Response Authenticity Guidelines (No sycophancy!)
  # Zero-BS Principle (No placeholders/stubs)
  # Build/Test/Lint Commands
  # Code Style Guidelines

  What it's trying to do:
  Encode team conventions so AI follows them consistently.

  Real value:
  - ✅ Reference for "how we do things here"
  - ✅ Prevents re-explaining patterns every session
  - ✅ Team consistency across different people's Claude sessions
  - ❌ Only works if you actually have established patterns
  - ❌ Overhead if patterns aren't settled yet

  3. DISCOVERIES.md - "Don't Learn This The Hard Way"

  What it contains:
  ## OneDrive/Cloud Sync File I/O Errors
  [Detailed problem, root cause, solution, prevention]

  ## Tool Generation Pattern Failures
  [Predictable failures and how to avoid them]

  ## LLM Response Handling and Defensive Utilities
  [JSON parsing issues, context contamination, retries]

  What it's trying to do:
  Institutional memory - lessons learned from debugging.

  Real value:
  - ✅ Genuinely useful for onboarding
  - ✅ Prevents repeating mistakes
  - ✅ Explains "why is the code written this way?"
  - ✅ Living document that gets updated
  - ❌ Only valuable if team actually reads it
  - ❌ Can become stale if not maintained

  4. IMPLEMENTATION_PHILOSOPHY.md - "Ruthless Simplicity"

  What it contains:
  # Core Philosophy
  - Wabi-sabi minimalism
  - Occam's Razor
  - Trust in emergence
  - Present-moment focus

  # Core Design Principles
  1. Ruthless Simplicity
  2. Architectural Integrity with Minimal Implementation
  3. Library Usage Philosophy

  # Decision-Making Framework
  [5 questions to ask when making decisions]

  What it's trying to do:
  Define the aesthetic and approach for all code in the project.

  Real value:
  - ✅ Helps Claude Code generate code matching your style
  - ✅ Useful reference during code review
  - ✅ Team alignment on "what good code looks like"
  - ❌ Only matters if you actually care about consistency
  - ❌ Overhead if "just make it work" is fine

  5. ai_context/ - "Claude Code SDK Reference"

  What it contains:
  - Complete docs for Claude Code SDK
  - Hooks reference
  - Slash commands guide
  - MCP integration
  - Custom tools patterns
  - Example code

  What it's trying to do:
  Provide Claude Code with reference material so it can help you use Claude Code features.

  Real value:
  - ✅ Claude can answer "how do I do X in Claude Code?"
  - ✅ Reduces need to search external docs
  - ✅ Keeps docs version-synced with your setup
  - ❌ Duplicates official docs (maintenance burden)
  - ❌ Only useful if you're building Claude Code extensions

  The Real Question: Does This Actually Help?

  Let me test the core claim with scenarios:

  Scenario 1: Solo Developer, New Project

  Without philosophy docs:
  You: "Add a caching layer"
  Claude: [Builds it however, maybe over-engineered]

  With philosophy docs:
  You: "Add a caching layer"
  Claude: "Let me check @ai_context/IMPLEMENTATION_PHILOSOPHY.md first"
  [Reads ruthless simplicity principles]
  Claude: [Builds simpler version following project style]

  Value: Medium
  - Prevents over-engineering
  - Consistency across features
  - But you could just say "keep it simple" in the prompt

  Scenario 2: Team Project, Multiple Developers

  Without philosophy docs:
  - Developer A asks Claude for feature X → Gets solution style A
  - Developer B asks Claude for feature Y → Gets solution style B
  - Inconsistent codebase, different patterns everywhere

  With philosophy docs:
  - All developers' Claude sessions read same AGENTS.md
  - Consistent patterns across team
  - New team members get oriented automatically

  Value: High
  - Team consistency
  - Reduces code review friction
  - Onboarding becomes "read these docs"

  Scenario 3: Long-Running Project with History

  Without DISCOVERIES.md:
  - Hit OneDrive I/O errors → Spend hours debugging
  - Generate tools with same bugs → Debug again
  - Repeat mistakes across team

  With DISCOVERIES.md:
  - Check DISCOVERIES first → "Oh, cloud sync issue, use retry utility"
  - Reference tool checklist → Avoid predictable failures
  - Institutional knowledge preserved

  Value: High
  - Saves debugging time
  - Prevents repeated mistakes
  - Knowledge doesn't live in one person's head

  Scenario 4: Just Using Claude Code

  Reality:
  You don't need any of this. You're just using Claude Code interactively.

  Value: Zero (pure overhead)

  What Makes This Different From Normal Documentation?

  Traditional docs:
  "Here's how to use the API"
  "Here's the command reference"

  Amplifier philosophy docs:
  "Here's how WE think about code"
  "Here's what we learned the hard way"
  "Here's how Claude Code should behave in OUR project"

  The key difference: These docs are executable. Claude Code reads them and changes behavior
  accordingly.

  The Honest Assessment

  When Philosophy/Docs Are Genuinely Valuable:

  1. You Have Established Patterns
  - Team has agreed on "how we do things"
  - Style matters (not just "make it work")
  - Consistency across codebase is important

  Value: 8/10 - Prevents drift, enables team scale

  2. You Want Claude to Learn Your Preferences
  - You have strong opinions on code style
  - You want AI to follow your aesthetic
  - You don't want to re-explain every session

  Value: 7/10 - Saves repetition, better results

  3. You're Building with Multiple People
  - Multiple developers using Claude Code
  - Need consistency across team
  - Onboarding new people regularly

  Value: 9/10 - Critical for team coherence

  4. You Have Hard-Won Lessons
  - You've debugged tricky issues
  - You've found non-obvious solutions
  - You want to preserve that knowledge

  Value: 8/10 - DISCOVERIES.md alone is worth it

  When Philosophy/Docs Are Overhead:

  1. Solo Project, Early Stage
  - Patterns aren't established yet
  - Still figuring out what works
  - Flexibility > consistency

  Value: 2/10 - Premature optimization

  2. Simple/Throwaway Project
  - Just need something working
  - Code quality doesn't matter much
  - Not maintaining long-term

  Value: 0/10 - Pure overhead

  3. You're Just Using Claude Code
  - Not building Amplifier-style tools
  - Interactive coding only
  - No team to coordinate

  Value: 0/10 - Irrelevant

  The Unique Insight: DISCOVERIES.md

  Among all the docs, DISCOVERIES.md is special because it captures anti-knowledge - things
  that don't work, gotchas, non-obvious failures.

  Why it matters:
  ## OneDrive/Cloud Sync File I/O Errors
  OSError errno 5 appears random but it's cloud sync.
  [Detailed solution with code]

  Without this:
  - Hit error → Google → Find nothing helpful → Debug for hours
  - Finally figure out it's cloud sync
  - Next person hits same error → Repeats process

  With this:
  - Hit error → Check DISCOVERIES.md → "Oh, cloud sync, here's the fix"
  - 5 minutes instead of 5 hours

  This is genuinely unique value - Google won't help with your project-specific gotchas.

  My Honest Take

  The philosophy/documentation system is:

  For established teams building serious projects:
  - Critical infrastructure
  - Enables scale and consistency
  - Preserves institutional knowledge
  - Value: 9/10

  For solo developers with strong preferences:
  - Useful for consistency
  - Prevents re-explaining to Claude
  - DISCOVERIES especially valuable
  - Value: 6/10

  For early-stage/exploratory projects:
  - Premature - patterns aren't settled
  - Overhead without benefit
  - Value: 1/10

  For casual Claude Code use:
  - Completely irrelevant
  - Value: 0/10

  The Positioning Problem

  Current positioning:
  Philosophy and docs are presented as core features of Amplifier.

  Better positioning:
  "Working on a team? Encode your patterns in AGENTS.md so everyone's Claude follows them.

  Have hard-won lessons? Put them in DISCOVERIES.md so your team doesn't repeat mistakes.

  Want Claude to match your style? Configure it in CLAUDE.md.

  Solo dev on a simple project? You probably don't need these."

  The real insight:
  These docs aren't features - they're infrastructure for human-AI collaboration at scale.

  They solve: "How do we get multiple people's AI assistants to follow the same patterns and
  learn from the same mistakes?"

  That's a real problem, but only for specific contexts (teams, long-term projects,
  established patterns).
