## Architecture & Design Patterns

### Core Architectural Principles

**Context-First Architecture:**
- Pre-load appropriate context before execution begins
- Use context-package.json for context gathering specifications
- Eliminate execution uncertainty through upfront context loading
- Ensure agents have necessary information before starting work
_(source: [catlog22/Claude-Code-Workflow](https://github.com/catlog22/Claude-Code-Workflow))_

**JSON-First State Management:**
- Use JSON files as single source of truth for task states
- Generate markdown files as read-only views
- Enable programmatic orchestration without state drift
- Separate data (JSON) from presentation (markdown)
_(source: [catlog22/Claude-Code-Workflow](https://github.com/catlog22/Claude-Code-Workflow))_

**Dual-Loop Architecture:**
- Manual slash commands for interactive use
- Automated GitHub Actions for CI/CD integration
- Both loops share same underlying agent logic
- Flexible triggering based on user preference
_(source: [OneRedOak/claude-code-workflows](https://github.com/OneRedOak/claude-code-workflows))_

**Hierarchical Documentation:**
- Root level: Project-wide context and standards
- Domain level: Feature area documentation
- Module level: Component-specific details
- Sub-module level: Implementation specifics
- Each layer provides context at appropriate abstraction level
_(source: [catlog22/Claude-Code-Workflow](https://github.com/catlog22/Claude-Code-Workflow))_

**Multi-Model Strategic Orchestration:**
- Route analysis tasks to Gemini/Qwen (large context windows)
- Route implementation to Codex (autonomous execution)
- Maintain context continuity via resume patterns
- Achieve 5-10x better task handling
_(source: [catlog22/Claude-Code-Workflow](https://github.com/catlog22/Claude-Code-Workflow))_

### Design Patterns

**Specification-Driven Development:**
- Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation flow
- EARS-format requirement specifications
- Atomic, testable specifications
- Full traceability from requirement to code
_(source: [pdoronila/cc-sdd](https://github.com/pdoronila/cc-sdd))_

**Quality Gate Pattern:**
- Phase 1 (Planning): Requirements, architecture, task validation
- Phase 2 (Development): Coverage, metrics, security, performance
- Phase 3 (Production): Quality scoring, documentation, deployment readiness
_(source: [zhsama/claude-sub-agent](https://github.com/zhsama/claude-sub-agent))_

**Context Optimization Pattern:**
- Universal context sharing reduces token usage by 60-80%
- Intelligent file change detection for cache invalidation
- Session-based caching for frequently accessed documents
- Bulk template loading with optimization commands
_(source: [Pimzino/claude-code-spec-workflow](https://github.com/Pimzino/claude-code-spec-workflow))_

**Agent Coordination Pattern:**
- Each agent reads previous phase outputs
- Requirements flow through design to tasks
- Orchestrator manages transitions
- Context maintained via coordination documents
_(source: [pdoronila/cc-sdd](https://github.com/pdoronila/cc-sdd))_
