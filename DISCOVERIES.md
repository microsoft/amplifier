## OneDrive/Cloud Sync File I/O Errors (2025-01-21)

### Issue

Knowledge synthesis and other file operations were experiencing intermittent I/O errors (OSError errno 5) in WSL2 environment. The errors appeared random but were actually caused by OneDrive cloud sync delays.

### Root Cause

The `~/amplifier` directory was symlinked to a OneDrive folder on Windows (C:\ drive). When files weren't downloaded locally ("cloud-only" files), file operations would fail with I/O errors while OneDrive fetched them from the cloud. This affects:

1. **WSL2 + OneDrive**: Symlinked directories from Windows OneDrive folders
2. **Other cloud sync services**: Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud Drive can cause similar issues
3. **Network drives**: Similar delays can occur with network-mounted filesystems

### Solution

Two-part solution implemented:

1. **Immediate fix**: Added retry logic with exponential backoff and informative warnings
2. **Long-term fix**: Created centralized file I/O utility module

```python
# Enhanced retry logic in events.py with cloud sync warning:
for attempt in range(max_retries):
    try:
        with open(self.path, "a", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            f.write(json.dumps(asdict(rec), ensure_ascii=False) + "\n")
            f.flush()
        return
    except OSError as e:
        if e.errno == 5 and attempt < max_retries - 1:
            if attempt == 0:  # Log warning on first retry
                logger.warning(
                    f"File I/O error writing to {self.path} - retrying. "
                    "This may be due to cloud-synced files (OneDrive, Dropbox, etc.). "
                    "If using cloud sync, consider enabling 'Always keep on this device' "
                    f"for the data folder: {self.path.parent}"
                )
            time.sleep(retry_delay)
            retry_delay *= 2
        else:
            raise

# New centralized utility (amplifier/utils/file_io.py):
from amplifier.utils.file_io import write_json, read_json
write_json(data, filepath)  # Automatically handles retries
```

### Affected Operations Identified

High-priority file operations requiring retry protection:

1. **Memory Store** (`memory/core.py`) - Saves after every operation
2. **Knowledge Store** (`knowledge_synthesis/store.py`) - Append operations
3. **Content Processing** - Document and image saves
4. **Knowledge Integration** - Graph saves and entity cache
5. **Synthesis Engine** - Results saving

### Key Learnings

1. **Cloud sync can cause mysterious I/O errors** - Not immediately obvious from error messages
2. **Symlinked directories inherit cloud sync behavior** - WSL directories linked to OneDrive folders are affected
3. **"Always keep on device" setting fixes it** - Ensures files are locally available
4. **Retry logic should be informative** - Tell users WHY retries are happening
5. **Centralized utilities prevent duplication** - One retry utility for all file operations

### Prevention

- Enable "Always keep on this device" for any OneDrive folders used in development
- Use the centralized `file_io` utility for all file operations
- Add retry logic proactively for user-facing file operations
- Consider data directory location when setting up projects (prefer local over cloud-synced)
- Test file operations with cloud sync scenarios during development
