## Your Task

Analyze the provided knowledge to identify:

1. **Main Themes and Patterns**: Identify 3-5 overarching themes that emerge from the knowledge base. Look for recurring ideas, connected concepts, and central narratives.

2. **Knowledge Gaps**: Identify 2-5 specific gaps where current information would enhance the research. Focus on:
   - Recent developments not covered in the knowledge base
   - Practical applications or real-world examples needed
   - Technical details or implementation guidance missing
   - Current best practices or industry standards
   - Comparative analysis or alternatives

3. **Suggested Outline**: Create a logical 5-7 section outline for a comprehensive research report that would effectively present this knowledge.

## Output Format

Return your analysis as a JSON object with this exact structure:

```json
{
  "main_themes": [
    "Clear theme description 1",
    "Clear theme description 2",
    "Clear theme description 3"
  ],
  "knowledge_gaps": [
    "Specific gap needing current information 1",
    "Specific gap needing current information 2"
  ],
  "suggested_outline": [
    "Executive Summary",
    "Core Concepts and Foundations",
    "Key Relationships and Dependencies",
    "Practical Applications",
    "Current Challenges and Solutions",
    "Future Directions",
    "Recommendations"
  ]
}
```

Focus on actionable analysis that will guide the subsequent research stages. Be specific about gaps that would benefit from web search augmentation.
