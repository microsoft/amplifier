## Your Task

For each knowledge gap identified above, use web search to find:

1. **Current Information**: Latest developments, recent research, and up-to-date statistics
2. **Authoritative Sources**: Academic papers, industry reports, expert opinions, official documentation
3. **Practical Examples**: Real-world implementations, case studies, success stories
4. **Best Practices**: Current methodologies, standards, and recommendations
5. **Comparative Analysis**: Alternative approaches, competing solutions, trade-offs

## Search Strategy

- Use specific, targeted queries for each gap
- Prioritize recent sources (2023-2025)
- Focus on authoritative domains (.edu, .gov, .org, reputable tech sites)
- Look for primary sources over secondary reporting
- Gather diverse perspectives when applicable

## Output Format

Return your findings as a JSON object with this exact structure:

```json
{
  "augmented_insights": [
    {
      "gap": "The original knowledge gap being addressed",
      "findings": "Comprehensive summary of what you discovered through web search, including key facts, recent developments, and practical insights",
      "sources": [
        "Source 1 title or description",
        "Source 2 title or description"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Quality Guidelines

- Each finding should be substantial (3-5 sentences minimum)
- Include specific details, numbers, dates where relevant
- Synthesize information from multiple sources
- Focus on information not present in the original knowledge base
- Ensure findings directly address the identified gap

Search thoroughly and provide high-quality augmentation that significantly enhances the research.
