# Cross-Reference Index

This index maps the relationships between all 44 AI-First Development Principles. Understanding these connections helps you apply principles effectively and recognize when multiple principles work together (or trade off against each other).

**Status**: Initial version with #31 relationships mapped. Will be updated as each specification is completed.

**Last Updated**: 2025-09-30

## Relationship Types

- **Dependency**: Principle A requires Principle B to be effective
- **Enabler**: Principle A makes Principle B possible or easier
- **Synergy**: Principles A and B work exceptionally well together
- **Trade-off**: Principles A and B create tension that requires balance
- **Complement**: Principles A and B address related aspects of the same concern

## Relationship Clusters

### Cluster: Safe Regeneration
Principles that work together to enable safe, repeatable code generation:

- **#07** - Regenerate, Don't Edit
- **#31** - Idempotency by Design (foundation)
- **#27** - Disposable Components Everywhere
- **#26** - Stateless by Default
- **#10** - Git as Safety Net

**How they work together**: Idempotency (#31) ensures regeneration is safe. Statelessness (#26) makes operations more naturally idempotent. Disposable components (#27) mean you can throw away and regenerate without fear. Git (#10) provides rollback if regeneration goes wrong.

## Dependency Graph

This section will be populated as more specifications are completed. It will show:
- Which principles must be implemented first (foundational)
- Which principles build on others (derivative)
- Which principles are independent (can be adopted separately)

### Foundational Principles (No Dependencies)
- **#31** - Idempotency by Design

### Second-Layer Principles (Depend on Foundational)
- **#07** - Regenerate, Don't Edit (depends on #31)
- **#27** - Disposable Components (depends on #31)
- **#32** - Error Recovery Patterns (depends on #31)
- **#23** - Protected Self-Healing Kernel (depends on #31)

### Higher-Layer Principles

## Trade-off Relationships

Some principles create productive tensions that require balancing:

[To be documented as specifications are completed. Examples might include:
- Simplicity vs Observability
- Speed vs Safety
- Flexibility vs Constraints
- Automation vs Human Control]

## Implementation Paths

Suggested sequences for implementing principles based on your starting point:

### Path 1: Starting from Scratch
1. Start with **#31 - Idempotency by Design** (foundation)
2. [To be completed as more specs are available]

### Path 2: Retrofitting Existing System
[To be documented]

### Path 3: AI-First Greenfield Project
[To be documented]

## Updates

When completing a new specification:

1. **Add its relationships to this index** under the principle's entry
2. **Update related principles' entries** to reference the new spec
3. **Add to relevant clusters** if the principle fits an existing pattern
4. **Update dependency graph** to show where it fits in the hierarchy
5. **Document any trade-offs** if the principle creates tensions
6. **Update implementation paths** if the principle changes recommended sequences

## Maintenance Notes

- This index should be updated every time a new specification is completed
- Bidirectional references should always be maintained (if A references B, B should reference A)
- When specifications are revised, check that cross-references remain accurate
- Periodically review clusters to ensure they still make sense as understanding evolves

**Next Update**: After completing specifications #07, #26, #27, or #32 (highest priority related to #31)
