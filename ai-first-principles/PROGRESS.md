## Priority Order for Next Specifications

Based on dependencies and importance for AI-first development, suggested completion order:

### High Priority (Foundation Principles)
1. **#07 - Regenerate, Don't Edit** - Core to AI-first workflow
2. **#08 - Contract-First Everything** - Enables modular development
3. **#09 - Tests as the Quality Gate** - Essential for validation
4. **#26 - Stateless by Default** - Foundation for reliability
5. **#32 - Error Recovery Patterns** - Complements idempotency

### Medium Priority (Enablers)
6. **#10 - Git as Safety Net** - Critical for safe experimentation
7. **#27 - Disposable Components** - Enables regeneration
8. **#25 - Simple Interfaces by Design** - Reduces complexity
9. **#28 - CLI-First Design** - Standard interaction pattern
10. **#23 - Protected Self-Healing Kernel** - System integrity

### Lower Priority (Important but Build on Others)
- Remaining Process principles (#11-19)
- Remaining Technology principles (#20-24, #29-30, #33-37)
- People principles (#01-06)
- Governance principles (#38-44)

## Quality Checklist for Each Specification

Before marking a specification as complete, verify:

- [ ] Plain-language definition is clear and concise
- [ ] "Why This Matters" section addresses AI-first specifically
- [ ] At least 4 implementation approaches provided
- [ ] 3-5 Good/Bad example pairs with working code
- [ ] 3-6 related principles with relationship explanations
- [ ] 5-7 common pitfalls with concrete examples
- [ ] Tools organized by category with specific features
- [ ] 8-12 actionable checklist items
- [ ] All metadata fields filled in
- [ ] Cross-references are valid and bidirectional
- [ ] Examples are syntactically correct and realistic
- [ ] Status and version information updated

## Notes

- **Reference Implementation**: Principle #31 (Idempotency by Design) serves as the quality standard for all specifications
- **Cross-References**: As each spec is completed, update related specs' cross-reference sections
- **Living Document**: This tracker should be updated after completing each specification
- **Quality Over Speed**: Better to have fewer high-quality specs than many incomplete ones

## Contributing

When working on a specification:

1. Copy `TEMPLATE.md` to the appropriate directory
2. Follow the structure exactly as shown in the template
3. Reference #31 for quality standards
4. Update this PROGRESS.md file when complete
5. Update related specifications' cross-reference sections
6. Update `cross-reference-index.md` with new relationships
