# Principle #52 - Multi-Agent Orchestration

## Plain-Language Definition

Multi-agent orchestration is the coordination of multiple specialized AI agents working together to solve complex problems that exceed the capabilities of any single agent. Each agent has a specific role and expertise, and an orchestration layer manages how they communicate, share information, and combine their outputs to achieve a common goal.

## Why This Matters for AI-First Development

When AI agents build and modify systems, single-agent approaches quickly hit fundamental limits: context window constraints, single-perspective reasoning, inability to parallelize work, and lack of specialization. Multi-agent orchestration transforms these limitations into strengths by distributing work across specialized agents that can operate concurrently and independently.

AI-first development with multiple agents provides three critical advantages:

1. **Parallel exploration**: Multiple agents can simultaneously explore different solution paths, analyze various aspects of a problem, or process independent data streams. This parallelization dramatically reduces latency for complex tasks while improving coverage and reducing blind spots.

2. **Specialization and expertise**: Agents can be optimized for specific domains, reasoning styles, or task types. A research agent uses different prompts and tools than a code generation agent or a validation agent. This specialization improves accuracy and reliability compared to generalist agents trying to handle all aspects of a task.

3. **Emergent capabilities**: When agents collaborate, they create capabilities beyond what any individual agent possesses. A debate between multiple agents produces more nuanced analysis than a single agent's output. An orchestrator coordinating specialized workers can tackle problems that are too complex for sequential processing.

Without orchestration, AI systems attempting complex tasks either fail completely or produce inconsistent, low-quality results. A single agent trying to research, reason, code, and validate will make mistakes that compound across the workflow. An uncoordinated group of agents will duplicate work, contradict each other, and fail to integrate their insights. Effective orchestration creates coherent, reliable systems from specialized components.

## Implementation Approaches

### 1. **Sequential Pipeline (Workflow Chaining)**

Chain agents in a linear sequence where each agent processes the output of the previous one. This pattern trades latency for accuracy by making each step more focused and manageable.

When to use: Tasks with clear dependencies where each step builds on the previous result. Content creation (outline → draft → edit), data processing (extract → transform → validate), or analysis (research → synthesize → present).

```python
class SequentialPipeline:
    """Chain agents in sequence with validation gates."""

    def __init__(self, agents: List[Agent], validators: Dict[int, Validator] = None):
        self.agents = agents
        self.validators = validators or {}
        self.execution_history = []

    async def execute(self, input_data: Any) -> PipelineResult:
        current_output = input_data

        for idx, agent in enumerate(self.agents):
            # Execute agent
            result = await agent.process(current_output)

            # Optional validation gate
            if idx in self.validators:
                validation = self.validators[idx].validate(result)
                if not validation.passed:
                    return PipelineResult(
                        success=False,
                        stage=idx,
                        error=validation.error,
                        history=self.execution_history
                    )

            # Update state
            self.execution_history.append({
                "agent": agent.name,
                "input": current_output,
                "output": result,
                "timestamp": time.time()
            })

            current_output = result

        return PipelineResult(
            success=True,
            final_output=current_output,
            history=self.execution_history
        )
```

### 2. **Parallel Processing (Map-Reduce)**

Run multiple agents simultaneously on independent subtasks, then aggregate their results. This pattern maximizes throughput and enables diverse perspectives.

When to use: Tasks that can be decomposed into independent subtasks, or when you need multiple perspectives on the same problem. Document analysis across many files, evaluating different aspects of a solution, or implementing guardrails where one agent processes content while another screens for issues.

```python
class ParallelOrchestrator:
    """Execute agents in parallel and merge results."""

    def __init__(
        self,
        agents: List[Agent],
        merger: ResultMerger,
        max_concurrent: int = 5
    ):
        self.agents = agents
        self.merger = merger
        self.semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(max_concurrent)

    async def execute(self, input_data: Any) -> MergedResult:
        async def run_agent(agent: Agent) -> AgentResult:
            async with self.semaphore:
                return await agent.process(input_data)

        # Execute all agents concurrently
        tasks = [run_agent(agent) for agent in self.agents]
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)

        # Separate successes from failures
        successful = [r for r in results if not isinstance(r, Exception)]
        failed = [r for r in results if isinstance(r, Exception)]

        # Merge successful results
        merged = self.merger.merge(successful)

        return MergedResult(
            output=merged,
            success_count=len(successful),
            failure_count=len(failed),
            failures=failed
        )
```

### 3. **Hierarchical Orchestration (Manager-Worker)**

A central orchestrator agent dynamically decomposes tasks, delegates to specialized worker agents, and synthesizes their outputs. The orchestrator maintains the overall plan while workers focus on specific subtasks.

When to use: Complex tasks where subtasks can't be predicted in advance. Software development requiring changes to multiple files, research requiring gathering information from unpredictable sources, or planning where the next step depends on previous results.

```python
class HierarchicalOrchestrator:
    """Orchestrator dynamically delegates to specialized workers."""

    def __init__(
        self,
        orchestrator: Agent,
        workers: Dict[str, Agent],
        max_iterations: int = 10
    ):
        self.orchestrator = orchestrator
        self.workers = workers
        self.max_iterations = max_iterations
        self.task_history = []

    async def execute(self, goal: str) -> OrchestrationResult:
        context = {"goal": goal, "completed_tasks": [], "available_workers": list(self.workers.keys())}

        for iteration in range(self.max_iterations):
            # Orchestrator decides next action
            plan = await self.orchestrator.plan(context)

            if plan.action == "complete":
                # Task is done
                return OrchestrationResult(
                    success=True,
                    output=plan.synthesis,
                    iterations=iteration + 1,
                    history=self.task_history
                )

            # Execute delegated task
            worker = self.workers[plan.assigned_worker]
            result = await worker.process(plan.task)

            # Update context
            context["completed_tasks"].append({
                "task": plan.task,
                "worker": plan.assigned_worker,
                "result": result
            })
            self.task_history.append(context["completed_tasks"][-1])

        return OrchestrationResult(
            success=False,
            error="Max iterations reached",
            history=self.task_history
        )
```

### 4. **Debate/Consensus Pattern**

Multiple agents with different perspectives analyze the same input, discuss their findings, and converge on a synthesized conclusion. This pattern produces more robust, well-reasoned outputs.

When to use: Complex decisions requiring multiple viewpoints, situations where single-agent blind spots are costly, or validation where agreement between independent agents increases confidence. Decision-making for high-stakes actions, evaluation of complex code or designs, or analysis requiring balanced consideration of trade-offs.

```python
class DebateOrchestrator:
    """Multiple agents debate to reach consensus."""

    def __init__(
        self,
        moderator: Agent,
        debaters: List[Agent],
        max_rounds: int = 3,
        consensus_threshold: float = 0.8
    ):
        self.moderator = moderator
        self.debaters = debaters
        self.max_rounds = max_rounds
        self.consensus_threshold = consensus_threshold

    async def execute(self, question: str) -> DebateResult:
        debate_history = []

        for round_num in range(self.max_rounds):
            # Each debater provides perspective
            positions = []
            for debater in self.debaters:
                context = {
                    "question": question,
                    "debate_history": debate_history
                }
                position = await debater.argue(context)
                positions.append(position)

            debate_history.append({
                "round": round_num + 1,
                "positions": positions
            })

            # Moderator evaluates consensus
            evaluation = await self.moderator.evaluate_consensus(
                question=question,
                positions=positions,
                history=debate_history
            )

            if evaluation.consensus_score >= self.consensus_threshold:
                return DebateResult(
                    consensus_reached=True,
                    synthesis=evaluation.synthesis,
                    confidence=evaluation.consensus_score,
                    rounds=round_num + 1,
                    history=debate_history
                )

        # No consensus - return best synthesis
        final_synthesis = await self.moderator.synthesize(debate_history)
        return DebateResult(
            consensus_reached=False,
            synthesis=final_synthesis,
            rounds=self.max_rounds,
            history=debate_history
        )
```

### 5. **Evaluator-Optimizer Loop**

One agent generates solutions while another provides evaluation and feedback, iterating until quality criteria are met. This pattern enables continuous refinement beyond what single-pass generation achieves.

When to use: Tasks where iterative improvement is valuable and evaluation criteria are clear. Creative content that benefits from revision, complex solutions that may have subtle flaws, or outputs where quality can be objectively measured and improved.

```python
class EvaluatorOptimizerLoop:
    """Generator creates, evaluator critiques, iterate to improve."""

    def __init__(
        self,
        generator: Agent,
        evaluator: Agent,
        quality_threshold: float = 0.9,
        max_iterations: int = 5
    ):
        self.generator = generator
        self.evaluator = evaluator
        self.quality_threshold = quality_threshold
        self.max_iterations = max_iterations

    async def execute(self, task: str) -> OptimizationResult:
        current_output = None
        iteration_history = []

        for iteration in range(self.max_iterations):
            # Generate or improve solution
            if current_output is None:
                current_output = await self.generator.generate(task)
            else:
                feedback = iteration_history[-1]["evaluation"]
                current_output = await self.generator.improve(
                    task=task,
                    current=current_output,
                    feedback=feedback
                )

            # Evaluate solution
            evaluation = await self.evaluator.evaluate(
                task=task,
                output=current_output
            )

            iteration_history.append({
                "iteration": iteration + 1,
                "output": current_output,
                "evaluation": evaluation,
                "quality_score": evaluation.score
            })

            # Check if quality threshold met
            if evaluation.score >= self.quality_threshold:
                return OptimizationResult(
                    success=True,
                    final_output=current_output,
                    quality_score=evaluation.score,
                    iterations=iteration + 1,
                    history=iteration_history
                )

        return OptimizationResult(
            success=False,
            final_output=current_output,
            quality_score=iteration_history[-1]["quality_score"],
            iterations=self.max_iterations,
            history=iteration_history
        )
```

### 6. **Autonomous Agent with Tool Use**

A single agent operates autonomously with access to tools, making its own decisions about which tools to use and when. The orchestration layer manages tool execution and provides feedback to the agent.

When to use: Open-ended problems where the solution path can't be predetermined. Tasks requiring dynamic adaptation to results, problems where the agent must recover from errors, or situations where human oversight for every decision is impractical.

```python
class AutonomousAgent:
    """Agent with tool use in a feedback loop."""

    def __init__(
        self,
        agent: Agent,
        tools: Dict[str, Tool],
        max_steps: int = 20,
        require_human_approval: Set[str] = None
    ):
        self.agent = agent
        self.tools = tools
        self.max_steps = max_steps
        self.require_human_approval = require_human_approval or set()
        self.execution_log = []

    async def execute(self, task: str, human_callback=None) -> AgentResult:
        context = {"task": task, "execution_log": []}

        for step in range(self.max_steps):
            # Agent decides next action
            decision = await self.agent.decide(context)

            if decision.action == "complete":
                return AgentResult(
                    success=True,
                    output=decision.output,
                    steps=step + 1,
                    log=self.execution_log
                )

            # Check if human approval required
            if decision.tool in self.require_human_approval:
                if human_callback:
                    approved = await human_callback(decision)
                    if not approved:
                        return AgentResult(
                            success=False,
                            error="Human rejected tool use",
                            log=self.execution_log
                        )

            # Execute tool
            tool = self.tools[decision.tool]
            try:
                result = await tool.execute(decision.parameters)
                observation = {"success": True, "result": result}
            except Exception as e:
                observation = {"success": False, "error": str(e)}

            # Log execution
            self.execution_log.append({
                "step": step + 1,
                "thought": decision.reasoning,
                "action": decision.tool,
                "observation": observation
            })

            # Update context with observation
            context["execution_log"].append(self.execution_log[-1])

        return AgentResult(
            success=False,
            error="Max steps reached",
            log=self.execution_log
        )
```

## Good Examples vs Bad Examples

### Example 1: Document Analysis Pipeline

**Good:**
```python
class DocumentAnalysisPipeline:
    """Sequential pipeline with clear responsibilities."""

    def __init__(self):
        # Each agent has one focused job
        self.extractor = Agent(
            name="ContentExtractor",
            prompt="Extract text, tables, and images from documents. "
                   "Output structured data with metadata."
        )
        self.summarizer = Agent(
            name="ContentSummarizer",
            prompt="Create concise summary of extracted content. "
                   "Identify key themes and findings."
        )
        self.analyzer = Agent(
            name="InsightAnalyzer",
            prompt="Analyze summarized content for patterns, insights, "
                   "and actionable recommendations."
        )

    async def process(self, documents: List[str]) -> AnalysisResult:
        # Extract from all documents in parallel
        extracted = await asyncio.gather(*[
            self.extractor.process(doc) for doc in documents
        ])

        # Summarize combined extractions
        combined = self.combine_extractions(extracted)
        summary = await self.summarizer.process(combined)

        # Analyze summary for insights
        analysis = await self.analyzer.process(summary)

        return AnalysisResult(
            extractions=extracted,
            summary=summary,
            analysis=analysis
        )
```

**Bad:**
```python
class DocumentAnalysisPipeline:
    """Monolithic agent doing everything - no orchestration."""

    def __init__(self):
        # One agent trying to do everything
        self.agent = Agent(
            name="DoEverything",
            prompt="Extract text from documents, create summaries, "
                   "analyze content, find patterns, make recommendations. "
                   "Do all of this comprehensively."
        )

    async def process(self, documents: List[str]) -> AnalysisResult:
        # Single agent handles everything sequentially
        all_results = []
        for doc in documents:  # No parallelization
            result = await self.agent.process(doc)
            all_results.append(result)

        # No specialization, no clear workflow
        return all_results
```

**Why It Matters:** The good example uses specialized agents with clear responsibilities, enables parallel processing of documents, and creates a logical workflow where each step builds on the previous one. The bad example forces a single agent to handle extraction, summarization, and analysis simultaneously—leading to cognitive overload, inconsistent quality, and inability to parallelize work. The specialized approach produces better results faster.

### Example 2: Code Review System

**Good:**
```python
class CodeReviewOrchestrator:
    """Multiple specialized reviewers with synthesis."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.reviewers = {
            "security": Agent(
                prompt="Review code for security vulnerabilities. "
                       "Check for injection attacks, auth issues, data leaks."
            ),
            "performance": Agent(
                prompt="Analyze code for performance issues. "
                       "Identify inefficient algorithms, unnecessary operations."
            ),
            "style": Agent(
                prompt="Check code style and maintainability. "
                       "Verify naming conventions, documentation, clarity."
            ),
            "tests": Agent(
                prompt="Evaluate test coverage and quality. "
                       "Identify missing tests, edge cases."
            )
        }
        self.synthesizer = Agent(
            prompt="Synthesize multiple code reviews into coherent feedback. "
                   "Prioritize issues by severity and impact."
        )

    async def review(self, code: str) -> ReviewResult:
        # All reviewers analyze in parallel
        reviews = await asyncio.gather(*[
            reviewer.analyze(code)
            for reviewer in self.reviewers.values()
        ])

        # Synthesize into actionable feedback
        synthesis = await self.synthesizer.combine(reviews)

        return ReviewResult(
            individual_reviews=reviews,
            consolidated_feedback=synthesis,
            severity_breakdown=synthesis.severity_counts
        )
```

**Bad:**
```python
class CodeReviewOrchestrator:
    """Sequential reviews without synthesis."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.reviewer = Agent(
            prompt="Review code for security, performance, style, and tests. "
                   "Check everything thoroughly."
        )

    async def review(self, code: str) -> ReviewResult:
        # Single agent checks everything sequentially
        security_review = await self.reviewer.process(
            f"Check security: {code}"
        )
        performance_review = await self.reviewer.process(
            f"Check performance: {code}"
        )
        style_review = await self.reviewer.process(
            f"Check style: {code}"
        )
        test_review = await self.reviewer.process(
            f"Check tests: {code}"
        )

        # No synthesis - just concatenated reviews
        return ReviewResult(
            reviews=[
                security_review,
                performance_review,
                style_review,
                test_review
            ]
        )
```

**Why It Matters:** The good example leverages parallel execution to get results faster, uses specialized prompts for each review dimension (improving accuracy), and synthesizes findings into coherent feedback. The bad example processes reviews sequentially (4x slower), dilutes the agent's focus across multiple concerns, and dumps raw reviews without synthesis. Specialized orchestration produces higher quality reviews in less time.

### Example 3: Research Assistant

**Good:**
```python
class ResearchOrchestrator:
    """Hierarchical orchestration for research tasks."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.planner = Agent(
            prompt="Break research questions into investigable subtopics. "
                   "Identify dependencies and suggest search strategies."
        )
        self.searcher = Agent(
            prompt="Execute searches and evaluate source quality. "
                   "Extract relevant information from documents."
        )
        self.synthesizer = Agent(
            prompt="Integrate findings from multiple sources. "
                   "Identify patterns, conflicts, and knowledge gaps."
        )

    async def research(self, question: str) -> ResearchReport:
        # Plan research approach
        plan = await self.planner.decompose(question)

        # Execute searches in parallel
        search_results = await asyncio.gather(*[
            self.searcher.investigate(subtopic)
            for subtopic in plan.subtopics
        ])

        # Synthesize findings
        report = await self.synthesizer.integrate(
            question=question,
            plan=plan,
            findings=search_results
        )

        return ResearchReport(
            question=question,
            methodology=plan,
            findings=search_results,
            synthesis=report
        )
```

**Bad:**
```python
class ResearchOrchestrator:
    """Uncoordinated agents with no plan."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = [
            Agent(prompt="Search the web"),
            Agent(prompt="Summarize content"),
            Agent(prompt="Make conclusions")
        ]

    async def research(self, question: str) -> ResearchReport:
        # No planning - just run all agents
        results = []
        for agent in self.agents:
            result = await agent.process(question)
            results.append(result)

        # No clear workflow or synthesis
        return ResearchReport(results=results)
```

**Why It Matters:** The good example uses hierarchical orchestration where a planner decomposes the research question, multiple searchers work in parallel on subtopics, and a synthesizer integrates findings into a coherent answer. The bad example has no research strategy, agents don't build on each other's work, and there's no clear methodology. Strategic orchestration produces comprehensive, well-reasoned research.

### Example 4: Shared Memory Management

**Good:**
```python
class SharedMemoryOrchestrator:
    """Proper shared memory with access control."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.memory = {
            "global": {},      # Shared across all agents
            "private": {}      # Agent-specific memory
        }
        self.agents = {}
        self.locks = defaultdict(asyncio.Lock)

    async def execute_agent(
        self,
        agent_id: str,
        task: str,
        memory_scope: str = "global"
    ) -> AgentResult:
        # Get relevant memory
        if memory_scope == "global":
            memory = self.memory["global"]
        else:
            memory = self.memory["private"].get(agent_id, {})

        # Execute with memory context
        agent = self.agents[agent_id]
        result = await agent.process(
            task=task,
            memory=memory.copy()  # Read-only copy
        )

        # Update memory atomically
        async with self.locks[f"{memory_scope}:{agent_id}"]:
            if memory_scope == "global":
                self.memory["global"].update(result.memory_updates)
            else:
                if agent_id not in self.memory["private"]:
                    self.memory["private"][agent_id] = {}
                self.memory["private"][agent_id].update(
                    result.memory_updates
                )

        return result
```

**Bad:**
```python
class SharedMemoryOrchestrator:
    """Race conditions and memory corruption."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.memory = {}  # Shared mutable state
        self.agents = {}

    async def execute_agent(self, agent_id: str, task: str):
        # No memory isolation
        agent = self.agents[agent_id]

        # Direct access to shared memory - race conditions!
        result = await agent.process(
            task=task,
            memory=self.memory  # Mutable reference
        )

        # No synchronization - memory corruption possible
        self.memory.update(result.memory_updates)

        return result
```

**Why It Matters:** The good example properly isolates memory access with locks, provides read-only copies to prevent accidental corruption, and distinguishes between global and private memory scopes. The bad example allows concurrent modifications to shared state without synchronization, leading to race conditions, lost updates, and inconsistent memory. When multiple agents run concurrently, proper memory management is critical for correctness.

### Example 5: Error Handling and Recovery

**Good:**
```python
class ResilientOrchestrator:
    """Comprehensive error handling with recovery."""

    def __init__(self, agents: List[Agent], max_retries: int = 3):
        self.agents = agents
        self.max_retries = max_retries

    async def execute_with_retry(
        self,
        agent: Agent,
        task: Any,
        retry_count: int = 0
    ) -> AgentResult:
        try:
            result = await asyncio.wait_for(
                agent.process(task),
                timeout=30.0
            )
            return result

        except asyncio.TimeoutError:
            if retry_count < self.max_retries:
                logger.warning(
                    f"{agent.name} timeout, retry {retry_count + 1}"
                )
                return await self.execute_with_retry(
                    agent, task, retry_count + 1
                )
            return AgentResult(
                success=False,
                error="Timeout after retries"
            )

        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"{agent.name} failed: {e}")
            return AgentResult(
                success=False,
                error=str(e),
                traceback=traceback.format_exc()
            )

    async def execute_pipeline(self, tasks: List[Any]) -> PipelineResult:
        results = []
        failed_tasks = []

        for idx, task in enumerate(tasks):
            agent = self.agents[idx % len(self.agents)]
            result = await self.execute_with_retry(agent, task)

            if result.success:
                results.append(result)
            else:
                failed_tasks.append({
                    "task_index": idx,
                    "task": task,
                    "error": result.error
                })

        return PipelineResult(
            successful=results,
            failed=failed_tasks,
            success_rate=len(results) / len(tasks)
        )
```

**Bad:**
```python
class ResilientOrchestrator:
    """No error handling - cascade failures."""

    def __init__(self, agents: List[Agent]):
        self.agents = agents

    async def execute_pipeline(self, tasks: List[Any]):
        results = []

        # No error handling at all
        for idx, task in enumerate(tasks):
            agent = self.agents[idx % len(self.agents)]

            # One failure stops entire pipeline
            result = await agent.process(task)
            results.append(result)

        return results
```

**Why It Matters:** The good example implements timeouts to prevent hanging, retries for transient failures, logging for debugging, and graceful degradation when agents fail. The bad example has no error handling—a single agent failure stops the entire pipeline, timeouts can hang indefinitely, and there's no visibility into what went wrong. In production, proper error handling is essential for reliability.

## Related Principles

- **[Principle #48 - Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](48-chain-of-thought-reasoning.md)** - Individual agents within orchestrated systems use chain-of-thought to break down their assigned subtasks. Orchestration operates at a higher level, coordinating multiple reasoning processes.

- **[Principle #49 - Tool Use Patterns](49-tool-use-patterns.md)** - Agents within orchestrated systems use tools to interact with external systems. The orchestration layer manages tool availability, permissions, and result sharing between agents.

- **[Principle #51 - Context Window Management](51-context-window-management.md)** - Multi-agent orchestration helps overcome context window limits by distributing work across agents, each with their own context window. This enables processing of arbitrarily large tasks.

- **[Principle #13 - Parallel Exploration and Synthesis](../process/13-parallel-exploration-synthesis.md)** - Parallel agent execution is a form of parallel exploration. The orchestration layer implements the synthesis step, combining agent outputs into coherent results.

- **[Principle #26 - Stateless by Default](26-stateless-by-default.md)** - Agents should be stateless when possible, with state managed by the orchestration layer. This makes agents more reliable, testable, and reusable across different orchestration patterns.

- **[Principle #32 - Error Recovery Patterns](32-error-recovery-patterns.md)** - Orchestration layers must implement robust error recovery since failures can occur in any agent. Patterns include retries, fallbacks to alternative agents, and graceful degradation.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Over-Engineering the Orchestration**: Adding complex orchestration when a single agent would suffice. Multi-agent systems add latency, cost, and potential points of failure.
   - Example: Using three agents (planner, executor, validator) for a simple task like formatting text that a single agent handles perfectly.
   - Impact: 3x the cost, 3x the latency, and potential consistency issues between agents. The complexity burden outweighs any benefit.
   - Prevention: Start with single-agent solutions. Add orchestration only when you hit clear limitations: context window constraints, need for true parallelization, or demonstrable benefit from specialization.

2. **Agents Without Clear Boundaries**: Agents with overlapping responsibilities that duplicate work or contradict each other. Unclear specialization defeats the purpose of orchestration.
   - Example: Two agents both responsible for "analyzing code quality" with slightly different prompts, producing conflicting recommendations.
   - Impact: Wasted computation, contradictory outputs, and inability to determine which agent's results to trust. Users receive confusing, inconsistent feedback.
   - Prevention: Define clear, non-overlapping responsibilities for each agent. Document what each agent does and doesn't handle. Test agents individually before orchestrating them.

3. **Ignoring Error Propagation**: Failing to handle errors at orchestration boundaries, allowing one agent's failure to cascade through the system.
   - Example: Pipeline where the second agent expects structured data from the first agent, but no validation occurs. When the first agent returns an error message instead of data, the second agent crashes.
   - Impact: Entire workflows fail instead of gracefully degrading. Debugging is difficult because the error location is obscured. Systems are fragile and unreliable.
   - Prevention: Validate outputs between agents, implement retries and fallbacks, use circuit breakers for consistently failing agents, and maintain detailed execution logs.

4. **Synchronous When Parallel Would Work**: Using sequential orchestration for tasks that could run in parallel, unnecessarily increasing latency.
   - Example: Running three independent validation checks sequentially, taking 30 seconds total, when they could run in parallel in 10 seconds.
   - Impact: User-facing latency is 3x higher than necessary, reducing responsiveness and user satisfaction. Resources sit idle while waiting for sequential completions.
   - Prevention: Identify task dependencies explicitly. If tasks don't depend on each other's outputs, run them in parallel. Use profiling to identify sequential bottlenecks.

5. **No Shared Memory Management**: Agents sharing state without proper synchronization, leading to race conditions and inconsistent results.
   - Example: Multiple agents updating a shared findings dictionary concurrently without locks, causing lost updates and corrupted data structures.
   - Impact: Intermittent bugs that are hard to reproduce, inconsistent results between runs, and data corruption that silently produces wrong answers.
   - Prevention: Use proper synchronization primitives (locks, semaphores), provide read-only memory copies to agents, and design for message-passing rather than shared mutable state when possible.

6. **Inadequate Agent Communication**: Agents passing insufficient context to each other, forcing downstream agents to re-derive information or make assumptions.
   - Example: A research agent returns bullet points without preserving source citations, forcing the synthesis agent to guess which findings are most reliable.
   - Impact: Loss of important context, inability to verify or trace back findings, degraded quality of downstream agent outputs, and reduced transparency.
   - Prevention: Design explicit interfaces between agents. Include metadata (confidence scores, sources, reasoning). Validate that downstream agents receive everything they need.

7. **Missing Feedback Loops**: No mechanism for agents to learn from results or adapt their behavior based on downstream feedback.
   - Example: A code generation agent produces code that consistently fails validation checks, but never receives feedback about why or how to improve.
   - Impact: Repeated mistakes that never get corrected, wasted computation on flawed approaches, inability to improve system performance over time.
   - Prevention: Implement evaluator-optimizer patterns where appropriate, maintain execution histories, and use validator outputs to refine generator prompts or strategies.

## Implementation Checklist

When implementing multi-agent orchestration, ensure:

- [ ] **Task decomposition is justified**: Complexity of orchestration is warranted by the task requirements. Single-agent solution inadequacy is documented.
- [ ] **Agent responsibilities are clearly defined**: Each agent has a single, well-documented purpose with clear inputs and outputs. No overlap or ambiguity.
- [ ] **Communication interfaces are explicit**: Data formats, error cases, and metadata requirements are specified at agent boundaries.
- [ ] **Parallel execution is used where possible**: Independent tasks run concurrently. Sequential dependencies are explicitly documented and justified.
- [ ] **Error handling covers all agent interactions**: Timeouts, retries, fallbacks, and graceful degradation are implemented at orchestration boundaries.
- [ ] **State management prevents race conditions**: Shared state uses proper synchronization. Agents receive read-only copies or use message-passing.
- [ ] **Execution is observable and debuggable**: Logging captures agent decisions, inputs, outputs, and timing. Tracing shows complete execution paths.
- [ ] **Resource usage is monitored**: Token consumption, latency, and cost are tracked per agent and for the full orchestration.
- [ ] **Human oversight is available where needed**: Critical decisions or high-stakes actions can be reviewed or approved by humans.
- [ ] **Agents can be tested independently**: Each agent has unit tests verifying its behavior in isolation before orchestration.
- [ ] **Integration tests cover workflows**: End-to-end tests verify orchestration patterns produce correct results with proper error handling.
- [ ] **Performance degrades gracefully**: System continues functioning (possibly with reduced quality) when individual agents fail.
