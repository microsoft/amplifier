# Principle #53 - Prompt Iteration Workflows

## Plain-Language Definition

Prompt iteration workflows are systematic processes for refining prompts through repeated cycles of testing, measurement, and improvement. Rather than guessing at improvements, these workflows use structured experimentation and data-driven decision-making to evolve prompts from initial drafts to production-ready implementations.

## Why This Matters for AI-First Development

In AI-first systems, prompts are the primary interface for instructing AI agents, making their quality critical to system reliability. Unlike traditional code where bugs are often deterministic and reproducible, prompt-related issues can be subtle, context-dependent, and emergent. A prompt that works perfectly in testing might fail unpredictably in production, or degrade over time as model versions change or use cases evolve.

Without systematic iteration workflows, three critical problems emerge:

1. **Inability to measure improvement**: Teams make prompt changes based on intuition or cherry-picked examples rather than systematic evaluation. This leads to changes that improve some cases while breaking others, with no objective way to determine if the overall quality improved. What seems like a "small improvement" might actually degrade performance across the broader test set.

2. **No reproducibility of results**: When prompt development happens ad-hoc without documented iterations, successful prompts become "lucky accidents" that can't be replicated or explained. If a prompt starts failing, teams can't trace back through the iteration history to understand what worked and why, making debugging nearly impossible.

3. **Compounding of small errors**: Without systematic testing between iterations, small issues accumulate. Each "quick fix" introduces subtle regressions that go unnoticed until the prompt becomes unreliable. By the time problems surface in production, the prompt has drifted so far from its original design that fixing it requires starting over.

Systematic iteration workflows solve these problems by treating prompt development like software engineering: each iteration is documented, tested against a suite of examples, measured objectively, and only deployed if it demonstrates improvement. This approach transforms prompt development from an art into a science, enabling teams to confidently evolve prompts while maintaining quality.

## Implementation Approaches

### 1. **Baseline-Test-Measure-Iterate (BTMI) Cycle**

Establish a baseline prompt performance, make changes, measure impact, and iterate based on data:

```python
def btmi_iteration_workflow(prompt: str, test_cases: list, iterations: int = 5):
    """
    Systematic iteration workflow with measurement at each step

    Args:
        prompt: Initial prompt to iterate on
        test_cases: List of test inputs with expected outputs
        iterations: Number of iteration cycles
    """
    # Step 1: Establish baseline
    baseline_results = evaluate_prompt(prompt, test_cases)
    best_prompt = prompt
    best_score = calculate_score(baseline_results)

    print(f"Baseline score: {best_score:.2f}")
    save_iteration_results(0, prompt, baseline_results, best_score)

    # Step 2-4: Iterate with measurement
    for i in range(1, iterations + 1):
        # Generate variation based on previous results
        new_prompt = generate_variation(
            best_prompt,
            failure_cases=extract_failures(baseline_results),
            iteration=i
        )

        # Test the variation
        new_results = evaluate_prompt(new_prompt, test_cases)
        new_score = calculate_score(new_results)

        # Measure improvement
        improvement = new_score - best_score
        print(f"Iteration {i} score: {new_score:.2f} (delta: {improvement:+.2f})")

        # Keep if better
        if new_score > best_score:
            best_prompt = new_prompt
            best_score = new_score
            baseline_results = new_results
            print(f"  ✓ Keeping iteration {i}")
        else:
            print(f"  ✗ Discarding iteration {i}")

        # Document iteration
        save_iteration_results(i, new_prompt, new_results, new_score)

    return {
        "final_prompt": best_prompt,
        "final_score": best_score,
        "improvement": best_score - calculate_score(baseline_results),
        "iterations_tried": iterations
    }
```

**When to use**: When you have clear evaluation metrics and a good test set. Essential for any prompt being used in production.

**Success looks like**: Each iteration is either kept (because it improves performance) or discarded (with data showing why), providing a clear improvement trajectory.

### 2. **A/B Testing with Statistical Validation**

Compare prompt variants in parallel with statistical significance testing:

```python
def ab_test_prompts(
    prompt_a: str,
    prompt_b: str,
    test_cases: list,
    min_samples: int = 30,
    confidence_level: float = 0.95
):
    """
    Compare two prompt versions with statistical validation

    Returns which prompt is better with confidence level
    """
    results_a = []
    results_b = []

    print(f"Running A/B test on {len(test_cases)} test cases...")

    for i, test_case in enumerate(test_cases):
        # Run both prompts on same input
        output_a = generate_with_prompt(prompt_a, test_case["input"])
        output_b = generate_with_prompt(prompt_b, test_case["input"])

        # Score each output
        score_a = evaluate_output(output_a, test_case["expected"])
        score_b = evaluate_output(output_b, test_case["expected"])

        results_a.append(score_a)
        results_b.append(score_b)

        if (i + 1) % 10 == 0:
            print(f"  Completed {i + 1}/{len(test_cases)} tests")

    # Statistical analysis
    from scipy import stats

    avg_a = sum(results_a) / len(results_a)
    avg_b = sum(results_b) / len(results_b)

    # Paired t-test (same test cases for both)
    t_statistic, p_value = stats.ttest_rel(results_a, results_b)

    # Determine winner
    significant = p_value < (1 - confidence_level)

    result = {
        "prompt_a_avg": avg_a,
        "prompt_b_avg": avg_b,
        "improvement": ((avg_b - avg_a) / avg_a * 100),
        "p_value": p_value,
        "statistically_significant": significant,
        "winner": "prompt_b" if avg_b > avg_a and significant else
                  "prompt_a" if avg_a > avg_b and significant else "tie",
        "confidence": f"{confidence_level * 100}%"
    }

    # Report
    print(f"\nA/B Test Results:")
    print(f"  Prompt A average: {avg_a:.3f}")
    print(f"  Prompt B average: {avg_b:.3f}")
    print(f"  Improvement: {result['improvement']:+.1f}%")
    print(f"  P-value: {p_value:.4f}")
    print(f"  Winner: {result['winner']} " +
          ("(statistically significant)" if significant else "(not significant)"))

    return result
```

**When to use**: When comparing two specific prompt approaches and you need objective data to decide which is better. Especially important before deploying prompt changes to production.

**Success looks like**: Clear, data-backed decisions about which prompt variant performs better, with statistical confidence that the difference isn't due to chance.

### 3. **Gradient Descent-Style Iterative Refinement**

Make small, targeted improvements based on specific failure patterns:

```python
def gradient_refinement_workflow(
    initial_prompt: str,
    test_cases: list,
    max_iterations: int = 10,
    min_improvement: float = 0.01
):
    """
    Iteratively refine prompt by identifying and fixing specific failure patterns

    Similar to gradient descent: find the steepest gradient (biggest problem)
    and fix it, then repeat
    """
    current_prompt = initial_prompt
    iteration_history = []

    for iteration in range(max_iterations):
        # Evaluate current prompt
        results = evaluate_prompt(current_prompt, test_cases)
        current_score = calculate_score(results)

        print(f"\nIteration {iteration + 1}:")
        print(f"  Current score: {current_score:.3f}")

        # Analyze failures
        failures = [
            r for r in results
            if not r["success"]
        ]

        if not failures:
            print("  ✓ No failures - iteration complete")
            break

        # Group failures by pattern
        failure_patterns = cluster_failures(failures)

        # Find most impactful pattern to fix
        primary_pattern = max(
            failure_patterns,
            key=lambda p: len(p["cases"]) * p["severity"]
        )

        print(f"  Primary failure pattern: {primary_pattern['description']}")
        print(f"  Affects {len(primary_pattern['cases'])} cases")

        # Generate targeted fix
        refined_prompt = apply_targeted_fix(
            current_prompt,
            failure_pattern=primary_pattern,
            example_failures=primary_pattern['cases'][:3]
        )

        # Test refined prompt
        new_results = evaluate_prompt(refined_prompt, test_cases)
        new_score = calculate_score(new_results)
        improvement = new_score - current_score

        print(f"  New score: {new_score:.3f} (delta: {improvement:+.3f})")

        # Check if improvement is meaningful
        if improvement < min_improvement:
            print(f"  ✗ Improvement below threshold ({min_improvement})")
            break

        # Update and continue
        iteration_history.append({
            "iteration": iteration + 1,
            "prompt": current_prompt,
            "score": current_score,
            "pattern_fixed": primary_pattern['description'],
            "improvement": improvement
        })

        current_prompt = refined_prompt

    return {
        "final_prompt": current_prompt,
        "iterations": len(iteration_history),
        "history": iteration_history,
        "total_improvement": current_score - calculate_score(
            evaluate_prompt(initial_prompt, test_cases)
        )
    }
```

**When to use**: When you have diverse failure modes and want to systematically address them one at a time. Works well for complex prompts with multiple responsibilities.

**Success looks like**: Each iteration addresses the most impactful failure pattern, leading to measurable improvement until no significant failures remain.

### 4. **Multi-Dimensional Optimization**

Optimize prompts across multiple competing objectives (accuracy, speed, cost, safety):

```python
def multi_objective_iteration(
    prompt: str,
    test_cases: list,
    objectives: dict,  # e.g., {"accuracy": 0.5, "latency": 0.3, "cost": 0.2}
    iterations: int = 5
):
    """
    Iterate on prompt while balancing multiple objectives

    Args:
        objectives: Dictionary mapping objective names to weights (must sum to 1.0)
    """
    assert abs(sum(objectives.values()) - 1.0) < 0.01, "Weights must sum to 1.0"

    current_prompt = prompt
    best_composite_score = 0

    print("Multi-objective optimization:")
    print(f"  Objectives: {objectives}")

    for i in range(iterations):
        # Measure all objectives
        metrics = {
            "accuracy": measure_accuracy(current_prompt, test_cases),
            "latency": measure_latency(current_prompt, test_cases),
            "cost": measure_cost(current_prompt, test_cases),
            "safety": measure_safety(current_prompt, test_cases)
        }

        # Calculate weighted composite score
        composite_score = sum(
            metrics[obj] * weight
            for obj, weight in objectives.items()
        )

        print(f"\nIteration {i + 1}:")
        print(f"  Metrics: {metrics}")
        print(f"  Composite score: {composite_score:.3f}")

        if composite_score > best_composite_score:
            best_composite_score = composite_score
            best_prompt = current_prompt

        # Identify limiting objective (lowest weighted contribution)
        limiting_objective = min(
            objectives.keys(),
            key=lambda obj: metrics[obj] * objectives[obj]
        )

        print(f"  Limiting objective: {limiting_objective}")

        # Generate variation targeting the limiting objective
        current_prompt = optimize_for_objective(
            current_prompt,
            objective=limiting_objective,
            current_metrics=metrics
        )

    return {
        "best_prompt": best_prompt,
        "best_score": best_composite_score,
        "final_metrics": metrics
    }
```

**When to use**: When you have multiple competing goals (e.g., maximizing accuracy while minimizing cost and latency). Essential for production systems with real-world constraints.

**Success looks like**: A balanced prompt that achieves good performance across all objectives according to their relative importance, rather than excelling at one dimension while failing at others.

### 5. **Version Tree Exploration**

Maintain multiple prompt variations and explore branches systematically:

```python
class PromptVersionTree:
    """
    Track prompt variations as a tree structure for systematic exploration
    """
    def __init__(self, root_prompt: str, test_cases: list):
        self.root = {
            "id": "v0",
            "prompt": root_prompt,
            "parent": None,
            "children": [],
            "score": self.evaluate(root_prompt, test_cases),
            "test_cases": test_cases
        }
        self.versions = {"v0": self.root}
        self.next_id = 1

    def evaluate(self, prompt: str, test_cases: list) -> float:
        """Evaluate prompt and return score"""
        results = evaluate_prompt(prompt, test_cases)
        return calculate_score(results)

    def create_variation(
        self,
        parent_id: str,
        variation_strategy: str,
        description: str
    ) -> dict:
        """

        Args:
            parent_id: ID of parent version

                               "simplify", "add_constraints")
            description: Human-readable description of the change
        """
        parent = self.versions[parent_id]

        # Generate new prompt based on strategy
        new_prompt = apply_variation(
            parent["prompt"],
            strategy=variation_strategy
        )

        # Create new version node
        version_id = f"v{self.next_id}"
        self.next_id += 1

        new_version = {

            "score": self.evaluate(new_prompt, parent["test_cases"]),
            "strategy": variation_strategy,
            "description": description,
            "test_cases": parent["test_cases"]
        }

        # Add to tree
        self.versions[version_id] = new_version
        parent["children"].append(version_id)

        print(f"Created {version_id} from {parent_id}:")
        print(f"  Strategy: {variation_strategy}")
        print(f"  Score: {new_version['score']:.3f} " +
              f"(parent: {parent['score']:.3f}, " +
              f"delta: {new_version['score'] - parent['score']:+.3f})")

        return new_version

    def get_best_version(self) -> dict:
        """Find version with highest score"""
        return max(self.versions.values(), key=lambda v: v["score"])

    def explore_branch(
        self,
        start_id: str,
        strategies: list,
        depth: int = 3
    ):
        """

        """
        current_generation = [start_id]

        for level in range(depth):
            print(f"\nExploring level {level + 1}:")
            next_generation = []

            for version_id in current_generation:
                for strategy in strategies:
                    new_version = self.create_variation(
                        version_id,
                        strategy,
                        f"Level {level + 1} exploration"
                    )

            current_generation = next_generation

    def get_lineage(self, version_id: str) -> list:
        """Get path from root to version"""
        lineage = []
        current_id = version_id

        while current_id is not None:
            version = self.versions[current_id]
            lineage.insert(0, {
                "id": current_id,
                "score": version["score"],
                "description": version.get("description", "root")
            })
            current_id = version["parent"]

        return lineage
```

**When to use**: When you want to explore multiple improvement directions simultaneously and compare different approaches systematically. Useful for research and exploration phases.

**Success looks like**: A clear tree of prompt variations showing which strategies worked, enabling comparison of different evolutionary paths and identification of the most promising directions.

### 6. **Stopping Criteria Framework**

Systematically determine when to stop iterating:

```python
def iterate_with_stopping_criteria(
    prompt: str,
    test_cases: list,
    stopping_criteria: dict
):
    """
    Iterate until stopping criteria are met

    Args:
        stopping_criteria: Dictionary defining when to stop
            - min_score: Stop if score reaches this threshold
            - max_iterations: Maximum number of iterations
            - no_improvement_streak: Stop after N iterations without improvement
            - diminishing_returns_threshold: Stop when improvement drops below this
            - time_budget_seconds: Stop when time budget is exhausted
    """
    import time
    start_time = time.time()

    current_prompt = prompt
    current_score = calculate_score(evaluate_prompt(current_prompt, test_cases))
    best_score = current_score

    iteration = 0
    no_improvement_count = 0
    last_improvement = float('inf')

    print("Starting iteration with stopping criteria:")
    for criterion, value in stopping_criteria.items():
        print(f"  {criterion}: {value}")

    while True:
        iteration += 1

        # Check stopping criteria
        if stopping_criteria.get("max_iterations") and iteration > stopping_criteria["max_iterations"]:
            print(f"\n✓ Stopping: Reached max iterations ({iteration})")
            break

        if stopping_criteria.get("min_score") and current_score >= stopping_criteria["min_score"]:
            print(f"\n✓ Stopping: Reached target score ({current_score:.3f})")
            break

        if stopping_criteria.get("time_budget_seconds"):
            elapsed = time.time() - start_time
            if elapsed > stopping_criteria["time_budget_seconds"]:
                print(f"\n✓ Stopping: Time budget exhausted ({elapsed:.1f}s)")
                break

        if stopping_criteria.get("no_improvement_streak"):
            if no_improvement_count >= stopping_criteria["no_improvement_streak"]:
                print(f"\n✓ Stopping: No improvement for {no_improvement_count} iterations")
                break

        # Generate and test new variation
        new_prompt = generate_variation(current_prompt)
        new_score = calculate_score(evaluate_prompt(new_prompt, test_cases))
        improvement = new_score - current_score

        print(f"\nIteration {iteration}: {new_score:.3f} (delta: {improvement:+.3f})")

        # Update tracking
        if improvement > 0:
            current_prompt = new_prompt
            current_score = new_score
            no_improvement_count = 0

            # Check diminishing returns
            if stopping_criteria.get("diminishing_returns_threshold"):
                if improvement < stopping_criteria["diminishing_returns_threshold"]:
                    if last_improvement < stopping_criteria["diminishing_returns_threshold"]:
                        print(f"\n✓ Stopping: Diminishing returns (improvement < {stopping_criteria['diminishing_returns_threshold']})")
                        break

            last_improvement = improvement
            best_score = current_score
        else:
            no_improvement_count += 1

    return {
        "final_prompt": current_prompt,
        "final_score": current_score,
        "iterations_completed": iteration,
        "total_improvement": current_score - calculate_score(
            evaluate_prompt(prompt, test_cases)
        )
    }
```

**When to use**: Always. Every iteration workflow needs clear stopping criteria to avoid wasting resources on marginal improvements.

**Success looks like**: Iterations stop at the right time—when the prompt is "good enough" rather than pursuing perfect optimization that yields diminishing returns.

## Good Examples vs Bad Examples

### Example 1: Systematic Test-Driven Iteration

**Good:**
```python
def systematic_prompt_iteration():
    """
    Systematic iteration with clear test set and measurements
    """
    # Define comprehensive test set
    test_cases = [
        {"input": "Simple query", "expected_pattern": r"Direct answer"},
        {"input": "Complex multi-part query", "expected_pattern": r"Step-by-step"},
        {"input": "Ambiguous query", "expected_pattern": r"Clarification"},
        {"input": "Edge case: empty input", "expected_contains": "Error"},
        # ... 20+ more diverse test cases

**Bad:**
```python
def unsystematic_iteration():
    """
    Ad-hoc iteration without proper testing or measurement
    """
    # No test set defined
    prompt = "Answer questions"

    # Try it on one example
    result = llm.generate(prompt, "What is 2+2?")
    print(result)  # "4" - looks good!

    # Tweak the prompt because it "feels" too simple
    prompt = "Provide detailed answers to questions"

    # Try different example
    result = llm.generate(prompt, "What is the capital of France?")
    print(result)  # Long explanation - maybe too detailed?

    # Change again
    prompt = "Answer concisely"

    # Deploy without testing both cases
    return prompt  # No idea if this is better or worse
```

**Why It Matters:** Systematic iteration with a comprehensive test set catches regressions before deployment. The ad-hoc approach might improve one case while breaking others, with no way to know until production failures occur.

### Example 2: A/B Testing with Statistical Validation

**Good:**
```python
def proper_ab_test():
    """
    A/B test with sufficient sample size and statistical validation
    """
    prompt_a = "Original prompt..."
    prompt_b = "Improved prompt with examples..."

    # Large, diverse test set
    test_cases = load_test_cases(n=50)  # Statistically meaningful

    # Run both prompts on identical test set
    results_a = []
    results_b = []

    for case in test_cases:
        # Same input, different prompts
        output_a = generate(prompt_a, case["input"])
        output_b = generate(prompt_b, case["input"])

        # Objective scoring
        score_a = evaluate(output_a, case["expected"])
        score_b = evaluate(output_b, case["expected"])

        results_a.append(score_a)
        results_b.append(score_b)

    # Statistical analysis
    from scipy import stats
    t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_rel(results_a, results_b)

    avg_a = sum(results_a) / len(results_a)
    avg_b = sum(results_b) / len(results_b)
    improvement = ((avg_b - avg_a) / avg_a) * 100

    print(f"Prompt A average: {avg_a:.3f}")
    print(f"Prompt B average: {avg_b:.3f}")
    print(f"Improvement: {improvement:+.1f}%")
    print(f"P-value: {p_value:.4f}")

    # Decision rule
    if p_value < 0.05:  # 95% confidence
        if avg_b > avg_a:
            print("✓ Deploy Prompt B (statistically significant improvement)")
            return prompt_b
        else:
            print("✗ Keep Prompt A (B performed worse)")
            return prompt_a
    else:
        print("~ No significant difference, keep Prompt A")
        return prompt_a
```

**Bad:**
```python
def improper_ab_test():
    """
    "A/B test" without proper methodology
    """
    prompt_a = "Original prompt..."
    prompt_b = "New prompt..."

    # Test on tiny sample
    test1 = "Example 1"
    test2 = "Example 2"  # Only 2 tests!

    output_a1 = generate(prompt_a, test1)
    output_b1 = generate(prompt_b, test1)

    # Subjective evaluation
    print("Prompt A output:", output_a1)
    print("Prompt B output:", output_b1)
    # Looks at both, B "seems better"

    output_a2 = generate(prompt_a, test2)
    output_b2 = generate(prompt_b, test2)

    # No statistical analysis, just vibes
    if "I like B better":
        return prompt_b
```

**Why It Matters:** Proper A/B testing with statistical validation provides objective evidence of improvement. "Eyeballing" results on a handful of examples leads to confirmation bias and false confidence in changes that don't actually improve overall performance.

### Example 3: Documented Iteration History

**Good:**
```python
class PromptIterationLog:
    """
    Comprehensive logging of iteration process
    """
    def __init__(self, project_name: str):
        self.project = project_name
        self.iterations = []
        self.current_version = None

    def log_iteration(
        self,
        version: str,
        prompt: str,
        test_results: dict,
        score: float,
        reasoning: str,
        kept: bool
    ):
        """
        Document each iteration with full context
        """
        entry = {
            "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
            "version": version,
            "prompt": prompt,
            "test_results": test_results,
            "score": score,
            "reasoning": reasoning,
            "kept": kept,
            "previous_version": self.current_version,
            "improvement": score - self.get_current_score() if self.current_version else 0
        }

        self.iterations.append(entry)

        if kept:
            self.current_version = version

        # Save to disk for permanent record
        self.save()

    def get_iteration_report(self) -> str:
        """Generate human-readable iteration history"""
        report = [f"Iteration History for {self.project}\n"]
        report.append("=" * 60)

        for i, entry in enumerate(self.iterations, 1):
            report.append(f"\nIteration {i} - {entry['version']}")
            report.append(f"  Timestamp: {entry['timestamp']}")
            report.append(f"  Score: {entry['score']:.3f}")
            report.append(f"  Improvement: {entry['improvement']:+.3f}")
            report.append(f"  Decision: {'KEPT' if entry['kept'] else 'DISCARDED'}")
            report.append(f"  Reasoning: {entry['reasoning']}")

        return "\n".join(report)

    def rollback_to(self, version: str):
        """Rollback to previous iteration with full history preserved"""
        for entry in self.iterations:
            if entry["version"] == version:
                print(f"Rolling back to {version}")
                print(f"  Score: {entry['score']:.3f}")
                print(f"  Original timestamp: {entry['timestamp']}")
                self.current_version = version
                return entry["prompt"]

        raise ValueError(f"Version {version} not found in history")

# Usage
log = PromptIterationLog("customer_support_agent")

log.log_iteration(
    version="v1",
    prompt="Answer customer questions",
    test_results={"pass_rate": 0.65, "avg_score": 3.2},
    score=0.65,
    reasoning="Baseline version",
    kept=True
)

log.log_iteration(
    version="v2",
    prompt="Answer customer questions with empathy and examples",
    test_results={"pass_rate": 0.78, "avg_score": 3.9},
    score=0.78,
    reasoning="Added empathy and examples based on failure analysis",
    kept=True
)
```

**Bad:**
```python
# Iteration happens in scratch notes, no permanent record
"""
v1 - basic prompt, seemed ok
changed to v2 - added some stuff
v3 maybe? forgot what v2 was
current version works fine I think
"""

current_prompt = "Answer questions thoroughly and helpfully"
# No record of what changed, why, or what the test results were
```

**Why It Matters:** Documented iteration history enables debugging when prompts fail, understanding what improvements actually worked, and rolling back to known-good versions. Without documentation, teams waste time rediscovering what worked and why.

### Example 4: Multi-Dimensional Evaluation

**Good:**
```python
def multi_dimensional_iteration(prompt: str, test_cases: list):
    """
    Iterate while tracking multiple quality dimensions
    """
    dimensions = {
        "accuracy": lambda output, expected: calculate_accuracy(output, expected),
        "latency": lambda output, expected: measure_response_time(output),
        "cost": lambda output, expected: calculate_tokens(output) * COST_PER_TOKEN,
        "safety": lambda output, expected: check_safety_filters(output),
        "completeness": lambda output, expected: check_completeness(output, expected)
    }

    results = {dim: [] for dim in dimensions}

    for test_case in test_cases:
        output = generate(prompt, test_case["input"])
        expected = test_case["expected"]

        for dim_name, dim_func in dimensions.items():
            score = dim_func(output, expected)
            results[dim_name].append(score)

    # Report all dimensions
    report = "Multi-dimensional evaluation:\n"
    for dim_name, scores in results.items():
        avg = sum(scores) / len(scores)
        report += f"  {dim_name}: {avg:.3f}\n"

    print(report)

    # Identify weakest dimension
    averages = {
        dim: sum(scores) / len(scores)
        for dim, scores in results.items()
    }
    weakest_dim = min(averages, key=averages.get)

    print(f"Weakest dimension: {weakest_dim}")
    print(f"Next iteration should focus on improving {weakest_dim}")

    return {
        "scores": averages,
        "recommendation": f"Focus on {weakest_dim}"
    }
```

**Bad:**
```python
def single_dimension_iteration(prompt: str, test_cases: list):
    """
    Only track accuracy, ignore other important factors
    """
    correct = 0
    for test_case in test_cases:
        output = generate(prompt, test_case["input"])
        if output == test_case["expected"]:
            correct += 1

    accuracy = correct / len(test_cases)
    print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.1%}")

    # Ignores that responses might be:
    # - Extremely slow
    # - Prohibitively expensive
    # - Unsafe or inappropriate
    # - Incomplete

    return accuracy
```

**Why It Matters:** Production systems must balance multiple concerns. Optimizing only for accuracy can produce prompts that are too slow, expensive, or unsafe for real-world use. Multi-dimensional evaluation ensures prompts meet all requirements.

### Example 5: Stopping Criteria

**Good:**
```python
def iterate_with_smart_stopping(prompt: str, test_cases: list):
    """
    Iterate with multiple stopping criteria
    """
    max_iterations = 20
    target_score = 0.95
    diminishing_returns_threshold = 0.01
    no_improvement_limit = 3

    current_prompt = prompt
    current_score = evaluate(current_prompt, test_cases)
    best_score = current_score
    no_improvement_count = 0

    print(f"Starting score: {current_score:.3f}")
    print(f"Target score: {target_score:.3f}")

    for iteration in range(1, max_iterations + 1):
        # Generate variation
        new_prompt = generate_variation(current_prompt)
        new_score = evaluate(new_prompt, test_cases)
        improvement = new_score - current_score

        print(f"Iteration {iteration}: {new_score:.3f} (delta: {improvement:+.3f})")

        # Check stopping criteria
        if new_score >= target_score:
            print(f"✓ Reached target score!")
            current_prompt = new_prompt
            break

        if improvement < diminishing_returns_threshold:
            no_improvement_count += 1
            if no_improvement_count >= no_improvement_limit:
                print(f"✓ Stopping: {no_improvement_limit} iterations with minimal improvement")
                break
        else:
            no_improvement_count = 0

        if improvement > 0:
            current_prompt = new_prompt
            current_score = new_score

    print(f"Final score: {current_score:.3f}")
    print(f"Total improvement: {current_score - best_score:+.3f}")

    return current_prompt
```

**Bad:**
```python
def iterate_without_stopping():
    """
    Iterate forever or until arbitrary limit
    """
    for i in range(100):  # Why 100? No idea
        new_prompt = tweak_prompt()
        score = test_prompt(new_prompt)
        print(f"Iteration {i}: {score}")
        # Keeps iterating even if:
        # - Already reached good enough performance
        # - No improvements in last 50 iterations
        # - Making improvements of 0.001% that don't matter
```

**Why It Matters:** Smart stopping criteria prevent wasting resources on marginal improvements and ensure iteration stops when the prompt is "good enough." Continuing to iterate beyond diminishing returns wastes time and money.

## Related Principles

- **[Principle #17 - Prompt Versioning and Testing](17-prompt-versioning-testing.md)** - Iteration workflows depend on version control and testing infrastructure. This principle provides the foundation for systematic iteration.

- **[Principle #45 - Prompt Design Patterns](../technology/45-prompt-patterns.md)** - Iteration workflows often involve applying and testing different prompt patterns. Understanding common patterns helps guide iteration strategy.

- **[Principle #11 - Continuous Validation with Fast Feedback](11-continuous-validation-fast-feedback.md)** - Iteration workflows require fast feedback loops to be practical. Continuous validation enables rapid iteration cycles.

- **[Principle #09 - Tests as the Quality Gate](09-tests-as-quality-gate.md)** - Test suites serve as the objective measurement for iteration workflows. Without comprehensive tests, iteration is guesswork.

- **[Principle #15 - Output Validation and Feedback](15-output-validation-feedback.md)** - Iteration workflows use output validation to identify failure patterns and guide improvements. This principle provides the validation mechanisms.

- **[Principle #39 - Metrics and Evaluation Everywhere](../governance/39-metrics-evaluation-everywhere.md)** - Iteration workflows require clear metrics to measure improvement. This principle defines the evaluation framework.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Iterating Without a Test Set**: Making prompt changes without a comprehensive test set to measure impact.
   - Example: Tweaking a prompt based on one failing example without checking if the change breaks other cases.
   - Impact: Changes that improve one case while degrading overall performance, with no way to detect the regression until production failures.

2. **Cherry-Picking Test Cases**: Selecting test cases that show improvement while ignoring cases that got worse.
   - Example: Running tests on 100 cases, focusing on the 20 that improved, ignoring the 30 that degraded.
   - Impact: False confidence in improvements that actually hurt overall quality. Leads to deploying worse prompts thinking they're better.

3. **No Statistical Validation**: Treating small differences as meaningful without checking if they're statistically significant.
   - Example: Deploying a prompt that scored 0.78 instead of 0.76 on 5 test cases, assuming it's better when the difference could be random noise.
   - Impact: Chasing phantom improvements, wasting time on changes that don't actually help, inability to distinguish signal from noise.

4. **Iterating on Too Small a Sample**: Drawing conclusions from insufficient test data.
   - Example: A/B testing two prompts on 3 examples and choosing the winner.
   - Impact: Selected "winner" might perform worse on broader test set, leading to production failures.

5. **No Stopping Criteria**: Continuing to iterate without clear goals or stopping conditions.
   - Example: Spending days iterating to improve score from 0.94 to 0.95 when 0.90 was sufficient.
   - Impact: Wasted resources on marginal improvements, diminishing returns, opportunity cost of not working on more impactful improvements.

6. **Undocumented Iterations**: Not recording what was tried, what worked, and why.
   - Example: Trying 10 prompt variations, keeping one, with no record of what the other 9 were or why they failed.
   - Impact: Can't learn from past iterations, rediscover same dead ends, unable to rollback when problems occur.

7. **Single-Dimensional Optimization**: Optimizing only for accuracy while ignoring cost, latency, or safety.
   - Example: Improving accuracy from 85% to 90% by adding examples that triple response time and cost.
   - Impact: "Better" prompts that can't be used in production due to cost or latency constraints, misalignment with real-world requirements.

## Implementation Checklist

When implementing this principle, ensure:

- [ ] Comprehensive test set covers diverse inputs including edge cases and failure modes
- [ ] Baseline performance is measured and documented before any iterations begin
- [ ] Each iteration is tested against the full test set, not cherry-picked examples
- [ ] Objective metrics are defined for measuring prompt quality (not subjective assessment)
- [ ] Iteration decisions are data-driven with statistical validation where appropriate
- [ ] Every iteration is documented with version, test results, reasoning, and decision
- [ ] A/B tests use sufficient sample size (typically 30+ examples minimum) for statistical power
- [ ] Multiple dimensions are tracked (accuracy, latency, cost, safety) not just accuracy
- [ ] Clear stopping criteria are defined before iteration begins (target score, max iterations, diminishing returns threshold)
- [ ] Iteration history is preserved enabling rollback to any previous version
- [ ] Best practices from successful iterations are captured as reusable patterns
- [ ] Iteration workflow is integrated into CI/CD pipeline for continuous improvement
