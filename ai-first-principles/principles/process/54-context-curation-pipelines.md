# Principle #54 - Context Curation Pipelines

## Plain-Language Definition

Context curation pipelines are systematic workflows that prepare, validate, enrich, and maintain the context provided to AI systems. Instead of haphazardly assembling context at query time, these pipelines ensure that context is high-quality, relevant, properly formatted, and continuously improved through automated processing stages.

## Why This Matters for AI-First Development

AI agents are only as good as the context they receive. Poor context leads to hallucinations, irrelevant responses, incorrect code generation, and wasted API calls. When humans manually curate context, it's inconsistent, time-consuming, and doesn't scale. When AI agents create their own context on-the-fly, they lack the systematic quality controls needed for production systems.

Context curation pipelines solve this by treating context preparation as a first-class engineering discipline:

1. **Quality at scale**: Pipelines enforce consistent quality checks across thousands of documents, code files, or data records. Every piece of context goes through the same validation, cleaning, and enrichment stages, ensuring uniform quality regardless of volume.

2. **Continuous improvement**: Pipelines enable feedback loops where context quality is measured, analyzed, and automatically improved. When AI responses fail or underperform, the pipeline can trace back to specific context issues and remediate them systematically.

3. **Cost optimization**: Well-curated context reduces token waste by removing redundancy, improving relevance, and enabling better retrieval. Pipelines can compress, summarize, and filter context intelligently, reducing API costs while maintaining or improving response quality.

Without curation pipelines, context management becomes reactive and error-prone. Teams manually fix context issues one at a time, never addressing root causes. Context quality degrades as systems evolve. AI agents work with stale, poorly formatted, or irrelevant information. Token budgets are consumed by noise. Response quality varies unpredictably based on whatever context happened to be available.

Context curation pipelines transform context from an afterthought into a managed asset. They ensure that every piece of information an AI agent sees has been cleaned, validated, enriched with relevant metadata, and proven to produce good results. This systematic approach is essential when AI agents operate autonomouslyâ€”they need trustworthy, well-prepared context to make good decisions without human oversight.

## Implementation Approaches

### 1. **Multi-Stage Preprocessing Pipeline**

Build a pipeline with distinct stages for cleaning, validation, enrichment, and indexing:

```python
def curate_document_context(raw_docs: list[Document]) -> list[CuratedDocument]:
    """Multi-stage context curation pipeline"""

    # Stage 1: Clean and normalize
    cleaned = [clean_document(doc) for doc in raw_docs]

    # Stage 2: Validate quality
    validated = [doc for doc in cleaned if validate_quality(doc)]

    # Stage 3: Enrich with metadata
    enriched = [enrich_metadata(doc) for doc in validated]

    # Stage 4: Generate contextual embeddings
    embedded = [generate_contextual_embedding(doc) for doc in enriched]

    # Stage 5: Index for retrieval
    indexed = [index_for_search(doc) for doc in embedded]

    return indexed

def clean_document(doc: Document) -> Document:
    """Remove noise, fix formatting, normalize structure"""
    # Remove excessive whitespace
    text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', doc.text)
    # Fix encoding issues
    text = text.encode('utf-8', errors='ignore').decode('utf-8')
    # Normalize line breaks
    text = text.replace('\r\n', '\n')
    return Document(text=text, metadata=doc.metadata)

def validate_quality(doc: Document) -> bool:
    """Ensure document meets quality thresholds"""
    if len(doc.text) < 50:  # Too short
        return False
    if doc.text.count(' ') / len(doc.text) < 0.1:  # Not enough spaces (likely corrupted)
        return False
    if not any(c.isalpha() for c in doc.text):  # No alphabetic characters
        return False
    return True

def enrich_metadata(doc: Document) -> Document:
    """Add contextual metadata for better retrieval"""
    doc.metadata['word_count'] = len(doc.text.split())
    doc.metadata['topics'] = extract_topics(doc.text)
    doc.metadata['entities'] = extract_entities(doc.text)
    doc.metadata['curated_at'] = datetime.now().isoformat()
    return doc
```

**When to use:** Large-scale document processing, RAG system preparation, knowledge base construction.

**Success looks like:** Consistent quality across all documents, automatic rejection of low-quality content, enriched metadata enabling better retrieval.

### 2. **Contextual Chunking with Overlap**

Chunk documents intelligently while preserving context across boundaries:

```python
def create_contextual_chunks(
    document: str,
    chunk_size: int = 500,
    overlap: int = 100,
    add_document_context: bool = True
) -> list[Chunk]:
    """Create chunks with contextual information"""

    # Extract document-level context
    doc_context = generate_document_summary(document)

    chunks = []
    words = document.split()

    for i in range(0, len(words), chunk_size - overlap):
        chunk_words = words[i:i + chunk_size]
        chunk_text = ' '.join(chunk_words)

        if add_document_context:
            # Prepend contextual information to chunk
            contextualized = f"{doc_context}\n\n{chunk_text}"
        else:
            contextualized = chunk_text

        chunks.append(Chunk(
            text=contextualized,
            original_text=chunk_text,
            start_index=i,
            end_index=min(i + chunk_size, len(words)),
            document_context=doc_context
        ))

    return chunks

def generate_document_summary(document: str) -> str:
    """Generate concise context about the document"""
    # Use LLM to generate contextual summary
    prompt = f"""Provide a brief 1-2 sentence summary of this document
    that would help understand any excerpt from it:

    {document[:1000]}...

    Summary:"""

    summary = llm.generate(prompt)
    return summary.strip()
```

**When to use:** RAG systems, long document processing, semantic search implementations.

**Success looks like:** Chunks that are independently understandable, better retrieval accuracy, reduced context loss.

### 3. **Continuous Quality Monitoring**

Monitor context quality and automatically flag degradation:

```python
def monitor_context_quality(
    context_items: list[ContextItem],
    metrics_db: MetricsDatabase
) -> QualityReport:
    """Continuous monitoring of context quality"""

    quality_scores = []
    issues = []

    for item in context_items:
        # Calculate quality metrics
        readability = calculate_readability(item.text)
        relevance = calculate_relevance_score(item)
        freshness = calculate_freshness(item.updated_at)
        completeness = calculate_completeness(item)

        overall_score = (
            readability * 0.3 +
            relevance * 0.4 +
            freshness * 0.2 +
            completeness * 0.1
        )

        quality_scores.append(overall_score)

        # Flag issues
        if overall_score < 0.6:
            issues.append({
                'item_id': item.id,
                'score': overall_score,
                'issues': identify_issues(item, readability, relevance, freshness, completeness)
            })

        # Store metrics
        metrics_db.record_quality(item.id, {
            'readability': readability,
            'relevance': relevance,
            'freshness': freshness,
            'completeness': completeness,
            'overall': overall_score,
            'timestamp': datetime.now()
        })

    return QualityReport(
        average_quality=sum(quality_scores) / len(quality_scores),
        items_below_threshold=len(issues),
        issues=issues,
        timestamp=datetime.now()
    )

def calculate_readability(text: str) -> float:
    """Calculate readability score (0-1)"""
    # Use Flesch Reading Ease or similar
    words = len(text.split())
    sentences = text.count('.') + text.count('!') + text.count('?')

    if sentences == 0:
        return 0.5

    avg_words_per_sentence = words / sentences

    # Normalize to 0-1 range (ideal: 15-20 words per sentence)
    if 15 <= avg_words_per_sentence <= 20:
        return 1.0
    elif avg_words_per_sentence < 10 or avg_words_per_sentence > 30:
        return 0.3
    else:
        return 0.7

def calculate_freshness(updated_at: datetime) -> float:
    """Calculate content freshness (0-1)"""
    age_days = (datetime.now() - updated_at).days

    # Exponential decay: fresh=1.0, 30 days=0.5, 90 days=0.25
    return max(0.0, 1.0 - (age_days / 90))
```

**When to use:** Production RAG systems, knowledge bases, any system with evolving context.

**Success looks like:** Proactive identification of quality issues, trend analysis showing improvement, automatic alerts for degradation.

### 4. **Feedback-Driven Curation**

Use AI response quality to improve context curation:

```python
def feedback_driven_curation(
    query: str,
    retrieved_contexts: list[Context],
    ai_response: str,
    user_feedback: UserFeedback
) -> None:
    """Use feedback to improve context curation"""

    # Record interaction
    interaction = Interaction(
        query=query,
        contexts_used=[c.id for c in retrieved_contexts],
        response=ai_response,
        feedback=user_feedback,
        timestamp=datetime.now()
    )

    # Analyze what went wrong/right
    if user_feedback.rating < 3:  # Poor response
        # Identify problematic context
        for context in retrieved_contexts:
            context.negative_feedback_count += 1

            # If consistently producing bad results, flag for review
            if context.negative_feedback_count > 5:
                flag_for_review(context, reason="Consistent negative feedback")

        # Check if we're missing important context
        missing_context = identify_missing_context(query, retrieved_contexts, ai_response)
        if missing_context:
            create_curation_task(
                task_type="ADD_CONTEXT",
                description=f"Add context about: {missing_context}",
                priority="high"
            )

    elif user_feedback.rating >= 4:  # Good response
        # Boost these contexts
        for context in retrieved_contexts:
            context.positive_feedback_count += 1
            context.relevance_boost = min(1.0, context.relevance_boost + 0.05)

    # Store for analysis
    store_interaction(interaction)

def identify_missing_context(
    query: str,
    contexts: list[Context],
    response: str
) -> str | None:
    """Identify what context might be missing"""

    # Use LLM to analyze the gap
    analysis_prompt = f"""
    Query: {query}

    Retrieved contexts: {[c.text[:200] for c in contexts]}

    Response: {response}

    Is there important context missing that would have improved this response?
    If yes, describe what context is needed. If no, respond with "NONE".

    Missing context:"""

    analysis = llm.generate(analysis_prompt)

    return None if "NONE" in analysis else analysis.strip()
```

**When to use:** Customer-facing AI applications, systems where you can collect user feedback.

**Success looks like:** Context quality improves over time, automatic identification of gaps, reduced poor responses.

### 5. **Automated Context Freshness Pipeline**

Keep context up-to-date through automated refresh cycles:

```python
def maintain_context_freshness(
    context_store: ContextStore,
    refresh_config: RefreshConfig
) -> RefreshReport:
    """Automated pipeline to keep context fresh"""

    # Identify stale context
    stale_items = context_store.query(
        last_updated_before=datetime.now() - refresh_config.max_age
    )

    refreshed = []
    failed = []

    for item in stale_items:
        try:
            # Re-fetch source data
            if item.source_type == "documentation":
                new_content = fetch_documentation(item.source_url)
            elif item.source_type == "code":
                new_content = fetch_code_from_repo(item.source_path)
            elif item.source_type == "api":
                new_content = fetch_api_data(item.source_endpoint)
            else:
                continue

            # Check if content changed
            if new_content != item.raw_content:
                # Re-run curation pipeline
                curated = run_curation_pipeline(new_content, item.metadata)

                # Update context store
                context_store.update(item.id, curated)
                refreshed.append(item.id)

        except Exception as e:
            failed.append({'item_id': item.id, 'error': str(e)})

    return RefreshReport(
        items_checked=len(stale_items),
        items_refreshed=len(refreshed),
        items_failed=len(failed),
        failures=failed,
        timestamp=datetime.now()
    )

class RefreshConfig:
    """Configuration for context freshness"""
    max_age: timedelta = timedelta(days=30)
    refresh_batch_size: int = 100
    refresh_schedule: str = "daily"  # cron-style schedule
    priority_sources: list[str] = []  # Sources to refresh more frequently
```

**When to use:** Documentation systems, API reference contexts, any rapidly changing knowledge domains.

**Success looks like:** Context stays current automatically, no manual refresh needed, staleness metrics trending down.

### 6. **Semantic Deduplication Pipeline**

Remove redundant context intelligently:

```python
def deduplicate_context(
    contexts: list[Context],
    similarity_threshold: float = 0.85
) -> list[Context]:
    """Remove semantically duplicate or redundant context"""

    # Generate embeddings for all contexts
    embeddings = [generate_embedding(c.text) for c in contexts]

    # Find duplicate clusters
    kept = []
    removed = []

    for i, context in enumerate(contexts):
        is_duplicate = False

        for j, kept_context in enumerate(kept):
            similarity = cosine_similarity(embeddings[i], embeddings[kept.index(kept_context)])

            if similarity > similarity_threshold:
                # This is a duplicate - keep the higher quality one
                if context.quality_score > kept_context.quality_score:
                    removed.append(kept_context)
                    kept[j] = context
                else:
                    removed.append(context)

                is_duplicate = True
                break

        if not is_duplicate:
            kept.append(context)

    # Log deduplication results
    logger.info(f"Deduplicated {len(removed)} contexts from {len(contexts)} total")

    return kept

def merge_similar_contexts(
    context_a: Context,
    context_b: Context,
    similarity: float
) -> Context:
    """Merge two similar contexts into one enriched version"""

    # Use LLM to merge intelligently
    merge_prompt = f"""
    Merge these two similar contexts into one comprehensive version.
    Remove redundancy but keep all unique information.

    Context A: {context_a.text}

    Context B: {context_b.text}

    Merged context:"""

    merged_text = llm.generate(merge_prompt)

    return Context(
        text=merged_text,
        metadata={
            'merged_from': [context_a.id, context_b.id],
            'similarity': similarity,
            'merged_at': datetime.now().isoformat()
        },
        quality_score=(context_a.quality_score + context_b.quality_score) / 2
    )
```

**When to use:** Large knowledge bases, document collections with overlap, cost optimization efforts.

**Success looks like:** Reduced token usage, improved retrieval speed, maintained or improved response quality.

## Good Examples vs Bad Examples

### Example 1: Document Ingestion Pipeline

**Good:**
```python
def ingest_documents_with_curation(raw_files: list[Path]) -> IngestionReport:
    """Complete curation pipeline for document ingestion"""

    report = IngestionReport()

    for file in raw_files:
        try:
            # Stage 1: Parse and extract
            raw_text = extract_text(file)

            # Stage 2: Clean and validate
            cleaned = clean_text(raw_text)
            if not validate_quality(cleaned):
                report.rejected.append(file)
                continue

            # Stage 3: Chunk with context
            chunks = create_contextual_chunks(
                document=cleaned,
                chunk_size=500,
                overlap=100,
                add_document_context=True
            )

            # Stage 4: Enrich metadata
            for chunk in chunks:
                chunk.metadata['source_file'] = str(file)
                chunk.metadata['ingested_at'] = datetime.now().isoformat()
                chunk.metadata['quality_score'] = calculate_quality_score(chunk)

            # Stage 5: Generate embeddings
            for chunk in chunks:
                chunk.embedding = generate_embedding(chunk.text)

            # Stage 6: Store with indexing
            for chunk in chunks:
                vector_store.add(chunk)

            report.processed.append(file)

        except Exception as e:
            report.failed.append({'file': file, 'error': str(e)})

    return report
```

**Bad:**
```python
def ingest_documents_no_curation(raw_files: list[Path]):
    """No curation - just dump into vector store"""

    for file in raw_files:
        # Just extract and store, no validation or enrichment
        text = extract_text(file)
        chunks = text.split('\n\n')  # Naive chunking

        for chunk in chunks:
            embedding = generate_embedding(chunk)
            vector_store.add(chunk, embedding)

    # No quality checks, no metadata, no contextual information
    # No error handling, no reporting
```

**Why It Matters:** Raw ingestion leads to poor quality context that produces bad AI responses. Systematic curation ensures every piece of context meets quality standards, has proper metadata, and is optimized for retrieval. The difference between good and bad ingestion directly impacts AI response quality.

### Example 2: Context Validation

**Good:**
```python
def validate_context_comprehensive(context: Context) -> ValidationResult:
    """Multi-dimensional context validation"""

    issues = []
    warnings = []

    # Check length
    if len(context.text) < 50:
        issues.append("Context too short - minimum 50 characters")
    elif len(context.text) > 5000:
        warnings.append("Context very long - consider splitting")

    # Check readability
    readability = calculate_readability(context.text)
    if readability < 0.3:
        issues.append("Poor readability - consider rewriting")

    # Check for code blocks without language tags
    if '```' in context.text:
        code_blocks = re.findall(r'```(\w*)\n', context.text)
        if any(not lang for lang in code_blocks):
            warnings.append("Code blocks missing language tags")

    # Check for broken links
    links = re.findall(r'https?://[^\s]+', context.text)
    for link in links:
        if not verify_link(link):
            warnings.append(f"Broken link: {link}")

    # Check metadata completeness
    required_metadata = ['source', 'created_at', 'topic']
    missing_metadata = [k for k in required_metadata if k not in context.metadata]
    if missing_metadata:
        issues.append(f"Missing metadata: {missing_metadata}")

    # Check freshness
    if 'updated_at' in context.metadata:
        age = datetime.now() - datetime.fromisoformat(context.metadata['updated_at'])
        if age > timedelta(days=90):
            warnings.append(f"Context is {age.days} days old - consider refreshing")

    return ValidationResult(
        valid=len(issues) == 0,
        issues=issues,
        warnings=warnings,
        quality_score=calculate_overall_quality(context)
    )
```

**Bad:**
```python
def validate_context_minimal(context: Context) -> bool:
    """Minimal validation - just check if not empty"""
    return len(context.text) > 0
    # No quality checks, no metadata validation, no freshness checks
    # No readability analysis, no broken link detection
```

**Why It Matters:** Minimal validation allows low-quality context into the system, leading to poor AI responses. Comprehensive validation catches issues early, ensures metadata completeness, and maintains high quality standards. The validation layer is your defense against garbage context.

### Example 3: Contextual Embedding Generation

**Good:**
```python
def generate_contextual_embedding(chunk: str, document_context: str) -> Embedding:
    """Generate embedding with contextual enrichment"""

    # Prepend contextual information to chunk
    enriched_text = f"""Document context: {document_context}

Chunk content: {chunk}"""

    # Generate embedding from enriched text
    embedding = embedding_model.encode(enriched_text)

    return Embedding(
        vector=embedding,
        original_text=chunk,
        contextualized_text=enriched_text,
        metadata={
            'embedding_model': embedding_model.name,
            'embedding_dim': len(embedding),
            'created_at': datetime.now().isoformat(),
            'uses_contextual_enrichment': True
        }
    )

def add_situational_context_to_chunk(chunk: str, full_document: str) -> str:
    """Use LLM to generate contextual information for chunk"""

    prompt = f"""<document>
{full_document}
</document>

Here is the chunk we want to situate within the whole document:
<chunk>
{chunk}
</chunk>

Please give a short succinct context to situate this chunk within the overall
document for the purposes of improving search retrieval of the chunk.
Answer only with the succinct context and nothing else."""

    context = llm.generate(prompt, max_tokens=100)

    return f"{context.strip()}\n\n{chunk}"
```

**Bad:**
```python
def generate_basic_embedding(chunk: str) -> Embedding:
    """Generate embedding without any context"""

    # Just embed the chunk as-is
    embedding = embedding_model.encode(chunk)

    return Embedding(vector=embedding, original_text=chunk)

    # No contextual enrichment, no document-level information
    # Missing metadata, no provenance tracking
```

**Why It Matters:** Basic embeddings lose context when chunks are retrieved in isolation. Contextual embeddings preserve document-level information, dramatically improving retrieval accuracy. This is the difference between finding relevant chunks and missing them entirely.

### Example 4: Continuous Quality Monitoring

**Good:**
```python
def run_quality_monitoring_dashboard(context_store: ContextStore):
    """Continuous monitoring with actionable insights"""

    # Calculate metrics over time
    quality_trend = calculate_quality_trend(
        context_store,
        window=timedelta(days=30)
    )

    # Identify degrading contexts
    degrading = context_store.query(
        quality_trend="declining",
        min_usage_count=10
    )

    # Generate actionable report
    report = QualityReport(
        summary={
            'total_contexts': context_store.count(),
            'avg_quality': quality_trend.current_avg,
            'quality_change': quality_trend.change_percent,
            'contexts_needing_attention': len(degrading)
        },
        issues=[
            {
                'severity': 'high',
                'count': len([c for c in degrading if c.quality_score < 0.5]),
                'description': 'Contexts with critically low quality',
                'action': 'Review and refresh or remove'
            },
            {

                'count': len([c for c in context_store if c.age_days > 90]),
                'description': 'Stale contexts over 90 days old',
                'action': 'Refresh from source'
            }
        ],
        recommendations=[
            "Increase refresh frequency for documentation contexts",
            "Add validation for code snippet completeness",
            "Review contexts with consistently low retrieval scores"
        ]
    )

    # Store metrics for trending
    metrics_db.store(report)

    # Alert if quality drops significantly
    if quality_trend.change_percent < -10:
        send_alert(
            "Context quality degradation detected",
            details=report,
            severity="high"
        )

    return report
```

**Bad:**
```python
def check_quality_occasionally(context_store: ContextStore):
    """Manual, infrequent quality checks"""

    # Just count contexts
    total = context_store.count()
    print(f"Total contexts: {total}")

    # No metrics, no trending, no actionable insights
    # No alerts, no recommendations, no automation
```

**Why It Matters:** Occasional manual checks miss quality degradation until it's severe. Continuous monitoring with automated alerts catches issues early and provides actionable insights. Proactive quality management prevents bad AI responses before they happen.

### Example 5: Automated Context Refresh

**Good:**
```python
def automated_context_refresh_pipeline(
    context_store: ContextStore,
    source_monitor: SourceMonitor
):
    """Automated pipeline that keeps context fresh"""

    # Check for source updates
    updated_sources = source_monitor.get_updated_sources(
        since=datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1)
    )

    refresh_queue = []

    # Find contexts affected by source updates
    for source in updated_sources:
        affected_contexts = context_store.query(source_url=source.url)
        refresh_queue.extend(affected_contexts)

    # Also check for stale contexts
    stale_contexts = context_store.query(
        last_updated_before=datetime.now() - timedelta(days=30)
    )
    refresh_queue.extend(stale_contexts)

    # Process refresh queue
    for context in refresh_queue:
        try:
            # Re-fetch source
            new_content = fetch_source(context.source_url)

            # Re-run curation pipeline
            curated = run_curation_pipeline(
                new_content,
                existing_metadata=context.metadata
            )

            # Compare old vs new
            if calculate_similarity(context.text, curated.text) < 0.95:
                # Content changed significantly - update
                context_store.update(context.id, curated)
                logger.info(f"Refreshed context {context.id} - significant changes detected")
            else:
                # Content mostly unchanged - just update timestamp
                context.metadata['last_checked'] = datetime.now().isoformat()
                context_store.update_metadata(context.id, context.metadata)

        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Failed to refresh context {context.id}: {e}")
            # Mark as failed for retry
            context.metadata['refresh_failed'] = True
            context_store.update_metadata(context.id, context.metadata)

    logger.info(f"Refreshed {len(refresh_queue)} contexts")
```

**Bad:**
```python
def manual_context_refresh(context_store: ContextStore):
    """Manual, sporadic refresh when someone remembers"""

    # Someone manually updates contexts occasionally
    # No automation, no source monitoring, no systematic refresh
    # Contexts become stale, no one notices until AI responses degrade
    pass
```

**Why It Matters:** Manual refresh doesn't scale and leads to stale context. Automated pipelines keep context current without human intervention. Fresh context means accurate AI responses that reflect current information.

## Related Principles

- **[Principle #14 - Context Management First](14-context-management-first.md)** - Context curation pipelines are the systematic implementation of context management; curation ensures that managed context maintains high quality over time

- **[Principle #46 - Context Window Budget Management](../technology/46-context-window-budget.md)** - Curation pipelines optimize context to fit within budget constraints through compression, deduplication, and relevance filtering

- **[Principle #12 - Incremental Processing as Default](12-incremental-processing-default.md)** - Curation pipelines use incremental processing to handle large volumes of context without interruption; checkpoints ensure progress is not lost

- **[Principle #11 - Continuous Validation with Fast Feedback](11-continuous-validation-fast-feedback.md)** - Quality monitoring in curation pipelines provides continuous validation of context quality with fast feedback loops

- **[Principle #13 - Continuous Knowledge Synthesis](13-continuous-knowledge-synthesis.md)** - Context curation feeds into knowledge synthesis by ensuring high-quality input context; synthesis outputs become curated context for other systems

- **[Principle #31 - Idempotency by Design](../technology/31-idempotency-by-design.md)** - Curation pipeline operations must be idempotent so they can be safely retried; re-running curation produces the same result

## Common Pitfalls

1. **One-Time Curation Without Maintenance**: Curating context once during initial setup but never refreshing it leads to stale, outdated context that degrades AI response quality over time.
   - Example: Ingesting documentation at project start but never updating it as docs evolve. Six months later, AI gives outdated advice.
   - Impact: Incorrect AI responses, user frustration, wasted API calls on obsolete information.

2. **No Quality Metrics or Monitoring**: Running curation pipelines without measuring quality or tracking trends means you don't know if context is improving or degrading.
   - Example: Curating thousands of documents without tracking readability, freshness, or retrieval success rates.
   - Impact: Silent quality degradation, no visibility into what's working, inability to optimize.

3. **Ignoring Feedback Signals**: Not using AI response quality and user feedback to improve context curation misses opportunities for continuous improvement.
   - Example: Users consistently rate AI responses as poor when using specific contexts, but those contexts are never reviewed or improved.
   - Impact: Repeated failures, frustrated users, no learning from mistakes.

4. **Over-Curation That Removes Useful Detail**: Being too aggressive with compression, summarization, or filtering can remove important nuances that AI needs for accurate responses.
   - Example: Summarizing technical documentation so heavily that specific parameter names and usage examples are lost.
   - Impact: AI responses lack necessary detail, users have to ask follow-up questions, increased API costs from multiple rounds.

5. **No Deduplication Strategy**: Allowing redundant context to accumulate wastes tokens and can confuse AI with conflicting information.
   - Example: Multiple versions of the same documentation chunk embedded with slight wording differences, all retrieved together.
   - Impact: Wasted tokens, increased costs, potential for contradictory information in responses.

6. **Missing Metadata for Provenance**: Not tracking where context came from, when it was curated, and what quality checks it passed makes debugging and improvement impossible.
   - Example: AI gives incorrect information, but you can't trace which context chunk caused it or when it was added.
   - Impact: Can't fix problems at the source, can't validate context quality, no audit trail.

7. **Batch Processing Without Incremental Checkpoints**: Running long curation pipelines without checkpoints means interruptions lose all progress and have to restart from scratch.
   - Example: Curating 10,000 documents in a 6-hour pipeline that fails at hour 5. All work is lost.
   - Impact: Wasted compute resources, delayed deployments, frustration with unreliable pipelines.

- [ ] Curation pipeline has distinct stages (cleaning, validation, enrichment, indexing)
- [ ] Each stage has defined quality checks and validation criteria
- [ ] Pipeline uses incremental processing with checkpoints after each stage
- [ ] Context chunks include situational context from parent documents
- [ ] Metadata tracks source, creation date, quality score, and curation history
- [ ] Embeddings are generated from contextualized chunks, not raw text
- [ ] Duplicate and near-duplicate content is detected and merged or removed
- [ ] Quality metrics are calculated and tracked for every context item
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard shows quality trends and flags degradation
- [ ] Feedback loops connect AI response quality back to context quality
- [ ] Automated refresh pipeline keeps context up-to-date with source changes
- [ ] Stale context is automatically identified and queued for refresh or removal
