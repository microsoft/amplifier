# Principle #14 - Context Management as Discipline

## Plain-Language Definition

Context management as discipline means carefully controlling what information AI agents receive for each task, providing focused and relevant content rather than dumping entire codebases or documentation sets into their context windows.

## Why This Matters for AI-First Development

AI agents operate with limited context windowsâ€”typically 200,000 to 500,000 tokens, equivalent to a few hundred pages of text. When agents receive unfocused context, they waste precious tokens on irrelevant information, leaving less space for the actual task at hand. This leads to three critical problems:

1. **Diluted attention**: When an agent receives a 50-file codebase but only needs to modify 2 files, it spends cognitive resources parsing irrelevant code. The relevant details get buried in noise, leading to mistakes, missed edge cases, and incorrect assumptions.

2. **Context overflow**: Once context windows fill up, agents must choose what to forget. Without careful management, they might retain boilerplate code while forgetting critical business logic or drop important constraints while remembering irrelevant examples.

3. **Degraded reasoning**: AI agents perform better with focused information. A well-curated context of 20,000 tokens with exactly what's needed produces better results than a 200,000-token context dump that forces the agent to filter and prioritize on its own.

Effective context management transforms AI development from "throw everything at the agent and hope" to "provide exactly what's needed for excellent results." It's the difference between asking someone to find a specific book in a library by giving them the entire catalog versus directing them to the right shelf and section. The focused approach respects cognitive limits and maximizes the quality of the agent's output.

In AI-first systems where agents orchestrate other agents, poor context management compounds exponentially. Parent agents pass bloated context to child agents, who pass it to their children, creating a cascade of noise that degrades reasoning at every level.

## Implementation Approaches

### 1. **Progressive Context Loading**

Start with minimal context and expand only as needed:
- Begin with file/module summaries rather than full content
- Load detailed code only for files that require modification
- Use context breadcrumbs (imports, function signatures) to navigate without loading everything
- Implement "zoom levels" where agents can request more detail when needed

Success looks like agents completing 80% of tasks with summary-level context, loading full details only for the 20% that need it.

### 2. **Task-Specific Context Windows**

Create focused context based on task type:
- **Bug fix tasks**: Relevant code + failing test + recent changes to that code
- **Feature additions**: Interface definitions + similar existing features + relevant tests
- **Refactoring**: Target code + callers + test suite
- **Documentation**: Code being documented + existing doc examples + style guide

Each task type gets its own context template that ensures relevance while maintaining completeness.

### 3. **Modular Documentation Architecture**

Structure documentation to support targeted retrieval:
- Break large documents into focused, single-purpose sections
- Use consistent heading structures that enable semantic search
- Create explicit cross-references rather than embedding everything
- Maintain document summaries that help agents decide what to load

Success means an agent can find exactly the documentation section needed without reading entire documentation sets.

### 4. **Semantic Context Retrieval**

Use embeddings and vector search to retrieve relevant context:
- Index code, documentation, and past conversations by semantic meaning
- When given a task, retrieve the most relevant 5-10 items rather than everything
- Combine keyword search (for exact matches) with semantic search (for conceptual relevance)
- Re-rank results based on task type and historical success

This approach works especially well for large codebases where manual context curation becomes impractical.

### 5. **Context Budget Management**

Establish explicit token budgets for different context types:
- **Core task context**: 50% of budget (the files being modified, key interfaces)
- **Supporting context**: 30% of budget (related code, dependencies, examples)
- **System context**: 15% of budget (coding standards, project guidelines)
- **Working memory**: 5% of budget (conversation history, intermediate results)

Agents should track context consumption and make explicit trade-offs when approaching limits.

### 6. **Summary Chain Pattern**

For large information sets, create hierarchical summaries:
- Level 1: Executive summary (2-3 sentences per major component)
- Level 2: Component summaries (1 paragraph each)
- Level 3: Detailed content (full code, full documentation)

Agents work at Level 1 by default, diving to Level 2 or 3 only for components they're actively working with.

## Good Examples vs Bad Examples

### Example 1: API Endpoint Modification

**Good:**
```python
# Context provided to agent: Only relevant endpoint + shared types + test
# api/routes/users.py
@app.post("/users")
def create_user(user: CreateUserRequest) -> UserResponse:
    """Create a new user account"""
    # ... implementation

# api/types.py (relevant section only)
class CreateUserRequest(BaseModel):
    email: str
    name: str

class UserResponse(BaseModel):
    id: str
    email: str
    name: str
    created_at: datetime

# tests/test_users.py (relevant test only)
def test_create_user_success():
    response = client.post("/users", json={
        "email": "test@example.com",
        "name": "Test User"
    })
    assert response.status_code == 200
```

**Bad:**
```python
# Context provided to agent: Entire API module (12 files, 3000 lines)
# api/routes/__init__.py (full file, not needed)
# api/routes/users.py (full file with all 15 endpoints)
# api/routes/products.py (completely irrelevant)
# api/routes/orders.py (completely irrelevant)
# api/routes/payments.py (completely irrelevant)
# api/database.py (full file, only connection string needed)
# api/auth.py (full file, mostly irrelevant)
# api/middleware.py (full file, not relevant to user creation)
# api/types.py (full file with 50+ type definitions)
# api/utils.py (full file of helper functions)
# tests/test_users.py (all 30 tests, not just relevant one)
# tests/test_auth.py (completely irrelevant)
```

**Why It Matters:** The focused context uses ~300 tokens and gives the agent exactly what it needs. The unfocused context uses ~15,000 tokens, burying the relevant code in noise. The agent spends cognitive resources parsing irrelevant endpoints instead of understanding the user creation logic.

### Example 2: Documentation Structure for Context Retrieval

**Good:**
```markdown
# docs/api-authentication.md (focused, retrievable section)

## JWT Token Validation

Validate JWT tokens using the `verify_token()` function:

```python
from api.auth import verify_token

def protected_endpoint():
    token = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    user = verify_token(token)  # Raises UnauthorizedError if invalid
    return {"user_id": user.id}
```

**Token expiration**: Default 24 hours, configurable via `JWT_EXPIRATION_HOURS`
**Related**: See [Token Refresh](api-token-refresh.md) for refresh flow
```

**Bad:**
```markdown
# docs/api-documentation.md (monolithic, hard to retrieve relevant parts)

## API Overview
Our API provides comprehensive access to all platform features...
(500 lines of general information)

## Authentication
We use JWT tokens for authentication. Tokens are issued via the login endpoint
and must be included in the Authorization header...
(200 lines mixing authentication concepts)

### Token Types
We support multiple token types: access tokens, refresh tokens, and API keys...
(150 lines about token types)

### Token Validation
To validate tokens, use the verify_token function...
(50 lines about validation, finally relevant)

### Token Refresh
Refresh tokens allow extending sessions...
(100 lines about refresh)

## Authorization
Once authenticated, users need proper authorization...
(300 lines about authorization, mixing in validation concepts)
```

**Why It Matters:** The focused documentation allows agents to retrieve exactly "JWT token validation" and get 100 tokens of perfect context. The monolithic version requires loading 1300+ tokens to find the same information, and the relevant details are scattered across multiple sections.

### Example 3: Bug Fix Context Assembly

**Good:**
```python
# Context for fixing user login bug:

# TASK: Fix bug where users with special characters in email can't log in

# FAILING TEST (10 lines)
def test_login_with_special_chars():
    user = create_user("test+alias@example.com")
    response = login(user.email, user.password)
    assert response.status_code == 200  # Currently fails with 422

# RELEVANT CODE (30 lines)
def login(email: str, password: str):
    # Email validation regex
    if not re.match(r'^[a-z0-9]+@[a-z0-9]+\.[a-z]{2,}$', email):
        raise ValidationError("Invalid email")
    # ... rest of login logic

# RECENT CHANGES (5 lines from git log)
commit abc123 "Tighten email validation to prevent injection"
- Changed regex from permissive to strict pattern
- Accidentally excluded + and . characters

# RELATED ISSUE (3 lines)
Issue #123: "Can't log in after email validation update"
Reported by 5 users with Gmail + aliases
```

**Bad:**
```python
# Context for fixing user login bug:

# TASK: Fix bug where users can't log in

# ALL AUTHENTICATION CODE (500 lines)
# auth.py - full file with login, logout, registration, password reset
# oauth.py - full file with OAuth flows (irrelevant to bug)
# session.py - full file with session management
# middleware.py - full file with auth middleware

# ALL USER TESTS (300 lines)
# test_auth.py - all 20 authentication tests
# test_oauth.py - OAuth tests (irrelevant)
# test_sessions.py - session tests (irrelevant)

# COMPLETE GIT HISTORY (200 lines)
# Last 50 commits to auth system, including unrelated changes

# ALL RELATED ISSUES (150 lines)
# 10 open issues about authentication, mostly unrelated
```

**Why It Matters:** The focused context (48 lines, ~500 tokens) gives the agent everything needed to diagnose and fix the bug: the failure case, the buggy code, and the context of why it broke. The unfocused context (1150+ lines, ~10,000 tokens) buries these critical details in a sea of irrelevant information. The agent might miss the recent regex change or waste time investigating OAuth flows.

### Example 4: Feature Implementation Context

**Good:**
```python
# Context for implementing "export user data" feature:

# TASK: Add /users/{id}/export endpoint that returns user data as JSON

# EXISTING SIMILAR FEATURE (25 lines)
# For reference: Here's how we implement CSV export for orders
@app.get("/orders/export")
def export_orders():
    orders = db.query(Order).all()
    return {
        "data": [order.to_dict() for order in orders],
        "format": "json",
        "exported_at": datetime.now()
    }

# TARGET LOCATION (10 lines)
# api/routes/users.py - existing user endpoints
@app.get("/users/{id}")
def get_user(id: str) -> UserResponse:
    return db.query(User).filter_by(id=id).first()

# REQUIRED TYPES (15 lines)
class User(Base):
    id: str
    email: str
    name: str
    created_at: datetime
    # ... other fields

# PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS (5 lines from docs)
When exporting user data:
- Exclude password hashes
- Include email, name, created_at
- Include user's orders and comments
```

**Bad:**
```python
# Context for implementing export feature:

# TASK: Add export endpoint

# ENTIRE USER MODULE (800 lines)
# api/routes/users.py - all 25 user-related endpoints
# api/models/user.py - full User model with all methods
# api/services/user_service.py - all user business logic

# ENTIRE EXPORT SUBSYSTEM (600 lines)
# api/exports/csv.py - CSV export utilities (different format)
# api/exports/pdf.py - PDF export utilities (different format)
# api/exports/excel.py - Excel export utilities (different format)

# ALL PRIVACY DOCUMENTATION (400 lines)
# docs/privacy-policy.md - full company privacy policy
# docs/gdpr-compliance.md - full GDPR documentation
# docs/data-handling.md - comprehensive data handling guide

# ALL TESTS (500 lines)
# tests/test_users.py - all user endpoint tests
# tests/test_exports.py - all export tests for all formats
```

**Why It Matters:** The focused context (55 lines, ~600 tokens) provides everything needed: a similar feature to pattern-match, the place to add the code, the data structure, and the privacy requirements. The unfocused context (2300+ lines, ~20,000 tokens) overwhelms the agent with irrelevant export formats, unrelated user endpoints, and comprehensive privacy policies when only 5 lines of privacy requirements were needed.

### Example 5: Code Review Context

**Good:**
```python
# Context for reviewing pull request:

# PR SUMMARY
Title: Add rate limiting to login endpoint
Files changed: api/routes/auth.py, tests/test_auth.py
Lines: +45, -5

# CHANGED CODE (30 lines)
@app.post("/login")
@rate_limit(max_attempts=5, window=300)  # NEW
def login(credentials: LoginRequest):
    user = authenticate(credentials.email, credentials.password)
    if not user:
        raise UnauthorizedError()
    return create_session(user)

# RATE LIMIT IMPLEMENTATION (15 lines)
def rate_limit(max_attempts: int, window: int):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            key = f"ratelimit:{request.ip}:{func.__name__}"
            attempts = redis.incr(key)
            if attempts == 1:
                redis.expire(key, window)
            if attempts > max_attempts:
                raise TooManyRequestsError()
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

# RELEVANT SECURITY STANDARDS (10 lines from docs)
Rate Limiting Requirements:
- Login attempts: Max 5 per 5 minutes per IP
- Use Redis for distributed rate limiting
- Return 429 status with Retry-After header
```

**Bad:**
```python
# Context for reviewing pull request:

# ENTIRE PULL REQUEST THREAD (200 lines)
# All comments, discussions, status checks, CI logs

# ALL AUTHENTICATION CODE (500 lines)
# api/routes/auth.py - full file with all auth endpoints
# api/middleware/auth.py - authentication middleware
# api/services/auth_service.py - authentication business logic

# ALL MIDDLEWARE CODE (400 lines)
# api/middleware/cors.py - CORS middleware (irrelevant)
# api/middleware/logging.py - logging middleware (irrelevant)
# api/middleware/errors.py - error handling (irrelevant)

# ALL SECURITY DOCUMENTATION (800 lines)
# docs/security/overview.md - comprehensive security documentation
# docs/security/authentication.md - full authentication guide
# docs/security/authorization.md - authorization guide (irrelevant)
# docs/security/cryptography.md - crypto standards (irrelevant)

# ALL RATE LIMITING CODE (300 lines)
# Including rate limiters for API, uploads, downloads (different use cases)
```

**Why It Matters:** The focused context (55 lines, ~600 tokens) provides exactly what's needed for review: the changes, the implementation being used, and the relevant requirements. The unfocused context (2200+ lines, ~18,000 tokens) forces the reviewer (or AI agent) to parse through irrelevant authentication flows, unrelated middleware, and comprehensive security documentation. The signal-to-noise ratio drops from 100% to less than 3%.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Dumping Entire Codebases**: Providing all code because "the agent might need it" wastes context on irrelevant files and dilutes attention.
   - Example: Giving agent 50 Python files when task only touches 3 files.
   - Impact: Agent misses important details in relevant files because attention is diluted across 47 irrelevant files.

2. **Including Full Dependency Code**: Loading entire library source code instead of just API signatures and documentation.
   - Example: Including all of Django's source code when agent just needs to know how to use `@login_required` decorator.
   - Impact: Context window fills with framework internals instead of business logic.

3. **No Context Prioritization**: Treating all context equally instead of prioritizing what's most relevant to the task.
   - Example: Giving equal weight to "file being modified" and "tangentially related file imported once."
   - Impact: Agent might spend equal cognitive resources on primary and tertiary concerns.

4. **Over-Summarization**: Summarizing so aggressively that critical details are lost.
   - Example: "This function validates emails" instead of showing actual validation regex that contains the bug.
   - Impact: Agent cannot complete task without full details, must request additional context, wasting time.

5. **Stale Context**: Providing outdated code, documentation, or examples that no longer reflect current implementation.
   - Example: Documentation from v1.0 when codebase is on v3.0 with breaking changes.
   - Impact: Agent implements features using deprecated patterns or APIs that no longer exist.

6. **Missing Cross-References**: Providing isolated context without showing relationships to other components.
   - Example: Showing a function without its callers or dependencies, making it impossible to understand usage patterns.
   - Impact: Agent makes changes that break callers or violate component contracts.

7. **Context Thrashing**: Repeatedly loading and unloading context as agent navigates the codebase.
   - Example: Agent loads file A, then file B (dropping A), then needs A again but it's no longer in context.
   - Impact: Agent loses critical information and must request same context multiple times, degrading efficiency.
