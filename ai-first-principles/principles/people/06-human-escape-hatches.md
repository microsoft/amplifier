# Principle #06 - Human Escape Hatches Always Available

## Plain-Language Definition

Always provide immediate, reliable ways for humans to intervene, stop, or override AI decisions and actions. Every autonomous operation must have a clearly marked exit that returns control to humans without delay or complexity.

## Why This Matters for AI-First Development

When AI agents autonomously build, modify, and deploy systems, they operate at speeds and scales that can quickly amplify mistakes. A misconfigured deployment script running in a loop can destroy production data in seconds. An agent misunderstanding requirements can commit breaking changes across dozens of files before a human notices. An automated migration can corrupt databases before validation catches the error.

Human escape hatches are the critical safety mechanism that makes AI-first development viable. They acknowledge a fundamental truth: AI agents will make mistakes, misunderstand context, or encounter edge cases they can't handle. When these moments occur, humans need instant, reliable ways to stop the damage and regain control.

Three critical benefits emerge from always-available escape hatches:

1. **Risk mitigation**: AI agents can safely operate with greater autonomy when humans know they can intervene immediately. This paradoxically enables more automation because the safety net reduces the cost of AI mistakes.

2. **Trust building**: Developers trust AI systems more when they maintain control. Escape hatches demonstrate respect for human judgment and provide the psychological safety needed to delegate complex tasks to AI.

3. **Learning opportunities**: When humans intervene, they generate valuable signals about where AI agents struggle. These interventions become training data for improving AI behavior and identifying patterns that require human oversight.

Without escape hatches, AI-first development becomes dangerous. Autonomous agents operating without human override become black boxes that must be trusted completely or not used at all. Small errors compound into catastrophic failures. Teams abandon automation rather than risk losing control. The very power that makes AI agents valuable becomes a liability without reliable ways to stop them.

## Implementation Approaches

### 1. **Emergency Stop Mechanisms**

Every long-running AI operation should have an immediate stop button:
- Physical interrupt signals (Ctrl+C handlers)
- Web-based "Stop" buttons that halt execution immediately
- API endpoints that cancel in-progress operations
- File-based kill switches that agents check periodically

Success looks like: Hitting stop during a 100-file refactoring halts after the current file completes, with clear state about what was and wasn't modified.

### 2. **Manual Override Points**

Build explicit approval steps into automated workflows:
- Require human confirmation before destructive operations
- Pause for review at critical decision points
- Allow humans to modify AI-generated plans before execution
- Provide "dry run" modes that show what would happen without doing it

Success looks like: An AI agent generates a database migration script, displays it for review, and waits for explicit approval before applying it.

### 3. **Graduated Autonomy Levels**

Allow humans to adjust how much autonomy AI agents have:
- "Ask me first" mode: Agent proposes every action and waits for approval
- "Ask for destructive actions" mode: Agent proceeds automatically for safe operations
- "Notify and proceed" mode: Agent acts but sends notifications for review
- "Full autonomy with alerts" mode: Agent operates independently but triggers alerts on anomalies

Success looks like: A developer can dial AI autonomy up or down based on task complexity, system criticality, and their comfort level.

### 4. **Rollback and Undo Capabilities**

Every automated action should be reversible:
- Git commits for all code changes with detailed messages
- Database migration rollback scripts generated automatically
- Infrastructure changes recorded in audit logs with revert procedures
- Configuration snapshots taken before AI modifications

Success looks like: After an AI agent's changes cause tests to fail, one command reverts all changes across all affected files, returning to the last known-good state.

### 5. **Real-Time Progress Visibility**

Humans need to see what AI agents are doing to know when to intervene:
- Live progress indicators showing current operation
- Detailed logs streaming in real-time
- Status dashboards displaying agent state and actions
- Notification channels for significant events

Success looks like: Watching an AI agent work through a refactoring task, seeing each file being processed, and stopping it when you notice it's heading in the wrong direction.

### 6. **Circuit Breakers and Guardrails**

Automatic limits that trigger human intervention:
- Maximum number of files/resources modified in one operation
- Time limits after which operations require reauthorization
- Error rate thresholds that pause automation
- Scope limits that prevent agents from accessing sensitive areas

Success looks like: An AI agent attempting to modify more than 50 files in one operation automatically pauses and requests human approval to continue.

## Good Examples vs Bad Examples

### Example 1: Long-Running Code Generation

**Good:**
```python
class CodeGenerator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stop_requested = False
        signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, self._handle_stop)

    def _handle_stop(self, signum, frame):
        print("\n‚ö†Ô∏è  Stop requested. Completing current file...")
        self.stop_requested = True

    def generate_modules(self, specs: list[ModuleSpec]):
        for i, spec in enumerate(specs):
            if self.stop_requested:
                print(f"‚úì Stopped gracefully. Completed {i}/{len(specs)} modules.")
                print(f"  Resume with: --start-from={i}")
                break

            print(f"[{i+1}/{len(specs)}] Generating {spec.name}...")
            self.generate_module(spec)
```

**Bad:**
```python
def generate_modules(specs: list[ModuleSpec]):
    # No way to stop this once it starts
    for spec in specs:
        print(f"Generating {spec.name}...")
        generate_module(spec)
    # If this takes 2 hours and you realize the specs are wrong
    # after 10 minutes, you have to wait or kill the process and
    # lose all progress
```

**Why It Matters:** Code generation can take hours for large projects. Without graceful stop handling, developers must choose between killing the process (losing all progress) or waiting for completion (wasting time on wrong output). Escape hatches enable early detection of problems.

### Example 2: Automated Deployment

**Good:**
```python
class Deployment:
    def deploy_to_production(self, package: Package):
        # Show what will happen
        plan = self.create_deployment_plan(package)
        print("üöÄ Production Deployment Plan:")
        print(f"  Version: {package.version}")
        print(f"  Affected services: {', '.join(plan.services)}")
        print(f"  Database migrations: {len(plan.migrations)}")
        print(f"  Estimated downtime: {plan.estimated_downtime}")
        print("\n‚ö†Ô∏è  This will affect production systems.")

        # Require explicit confirmation
        confirmation = input("Type 'DEPLOY' to proceed: ")
        if confirmation != "DEPLOY":
            print("‚ùå Deployment cancelled")
            return

        # Provide emergency stop
        print("\nüí° Press Ctrl+C at any time to halt deployment")

        try:
            for step in plan.steps:
                print(f"  ‚ñ∫ {step.description}...")
                step.execute()
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            print("\n‚ö†Ô∏è  Deployment halted by user")
            rollback_plan = self.create_rollback_plan()
            print("üîÑ Rollback plan ready:")
            print(f"  Run: amplify rollback {plan.id}")
            raise
```

**Bad:**
```python
def deploy_to_production(package: Package):
    # No preview, no confirmation, no stop mechanism
    print("Deploying to production...")

    for service in package.services:
        deploy_service(service)  # No progress indication
        run_migrations(service)  # No way to stop
        restart_service(service)  # No confirmation

    print("Done!")
    # If something goes wrong halfway through, you don't know what
    # state the system is in or how to recover
```

**Why It Matters:** Production deployments are high-stakes operations. Without confirmation, preview, and stop mechanisms, a misconfigured deployment can cause outages before anyone realizes the mistake. Escape hatches prevent deployment disasters.

### Example 3: Database Migration

**Good:**
```python
class MigrationRunner:
    def run_migration(self, migration: Migration, dry_run: bool = True):
        if dry_run:
            # Show what would happen without doing it
            print("üîç DRY RUN: Migration preview")
            print(f"  Name: {migration.name}")
            print(f"  Affects {migration.affected_rows} rows")
            print(f"  SQL:\n{migration.sql}")
            print("\nüí° Run with --execute to apply changes")
            return

        # Require explicit execute flag
        print("‚ö†Ô∏è  EXECUTING MIGRATION ON LIVE DATABASE")
        print(f"  Name: {migration.name}")
        print(f"  Affects ~{migration.affected_rows} rows")

        # Create rollback script first
        rollback = self.create_rollback(migration)
        rollback_path = f"rollback_{migration.name}.sql"
        rollback_path.write_text(rollback.sql)
        print(f"‚úì Rollback script saved: {rollback_path}")

        # Provide last chance to stop
        time.sleep(3)  # 3-second pause to hit Ctrl+C
        print("  Applying migration...")

        self.db.execute_with_transaction(migration.sql)
        print(f"‚úì Migration complete")
        print(f"  If needed, rollback with: psql < {rollback_path}")
```

**Bad:**
```python
def run_migration(migration: Migration):
    # No preview, no rollback, no confirmation
    print(f"Running migration {migration.name}...")

    db.execute(migration.sql)

    print("Migration complete")
    # If this corrupts data, you have no easy way to undo it
    # You don't even know what it was about to do
```

**Why It Matters:** Database migrations can corrupt or lose data permanently. Without dry runs, rollback scripts, and confirmation steps, a single bad migration can destroy critical data. Escape hatches make migrations reversible and reviewable.

### Example 4: Automated Code Refactoring

**Good:**
```python
class Refactorer:
    def refactor_codebase(self, pattern: RefactorPattern):
        # Find all affected files first
        affected_files = self.find_affected_files(pattern)

        print(f"üìù Refactoring Preview:")
        print(f"  Pattern: {pattern.name}")
        print(f"  Affected files: {len(affected_files)}")
        for f in affected_files[:5]:
            print(f"    ‚Ä¢ {f}")
        if len(affected_files) > 5:
            print(f"    ... and {len(affected_files) - 5} more")

        # Require approval for large changes
        if len(affected_files) > 20:
            response = input(f"\n‚ö†Ô∏è  This will modify {len(affected_files)} files. Continue? (yes/no): ")
            if response.lower() != "yes":
                print("‚ùå Refactoring cancelled")
                return

        # Create git checkpoint before starting
        branch_name = f"refactor/{pattern.name}/{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')}"
        subprocess.run(["git", "checkout", "-b", branch_name])
        print(f"‚úì Created safety branch: {branch_name}")

        # Process with progress and stop capability
        for i, file in enumerate(affected_files):
            if self.stop_requested:
                print(f"\n‚ö†Ô∏è  Stopped at {i}/{len(affected_files)} files")
                print(f"  Revert with: git checkout main && git branch -D {branch_name}")
                break

            print(f"  [{i+1}/{len(affected_files)}] {file.name}... ", end="")
            self.refactor_file(file, pattern)
            print("‚úì")

        print(f"\n‚úì Refactoring complete on branch {branch_name}")
        print(f"  Review changes: git diff main")
        print(f"  Apply changes: git checkout main && git merge {branch_name}")
        print(f"  Discard changes: git checkout main && git branch -D {branch_name}")
```

**Bad:**
```python
def refactor_codebase(pattern: RefactorPattern):
    # No preview, no git safety, no progress indication
    files = find_all_python_files()

    for file in files:
        refactor_file(file, pattern)

    print("Refactoring complete")
    # If the refactoring breaks things, you don't know which files
    # were changed or have an easy way to undo it
```

**Why It Matters:** Automated refactoring can break code across an entire codebase. Without git branching, preview, and progress tracking, developers have no safe way to review changes or recover from mistakes. Escape hatches make large refactorings manageable.

### Example 5: AI Agent Workflow Execution

**Good:**
```python
class AgentWorkflow:
    def __init__(self, autonomy_level: str = "ask-first"):
        self.autonomy_level = autonomy_level
        self.actions_taken = []

    async def execute_task(self, task: Task):
        plan = await self.ai_agent.create_plan(task)

        # Always show the plan
        print("ü§ñ AI Agent Plan:")
        for i, action in enumerate(plan.actions):
            print(f"  {i+1}. {action.description}")
            if action.destructive:
                print(f"     ‚ö†Ô∏è  DESTRUCTIVE: {action.warning}")

        # Respect autonomy level
        if self.autonomy_level == "ask-first":
            response = input("\nProceed with this plan? (yes/no/edit): ")
            if response == "no":
                print("‚ùå Task cancelled")
                return
            elif response == "edit":
                plan = self.interactive_edit(plan)

        # Execute with intervention points
        for action in plan.actions:
            if action.destructive and self.autonomy_level != "full-auto":
                print(f"\n‚ö†Ô∏è  About to: {action.description}")
                response = input("Proceed? (yes/no/skip): ")
                if response == "no":
                    print("‚ùå Stopping execution")
                    break
                elif response == "skip":
                    print("‚è≠Ô∏è  Skipping this step")
                    continue

            print(f"  ‚ñ∫ {action.description}...", end="")
            result = await action.execute()
            self.actions_taken.append((action, result))
            print(" ‚úì")

        # Provide undo capability
        print(f"\n‚úì Task complete. {len(self.actions_taken)} actions taken.")
        print(f"  To undo: workflow.rollback()")

    def rollback(self):
        print("üîÑ Rolling back actions...")
        for action, result in reversed(self.actions_taken):
            if action.reversible:
                print(f"  ‚óÑ Undoing: {action.description}...")
                action.undo(result)
```

**Bad:**
```python
async def execute_task(task: Task):
    # AI agent runs without showing plan or asking permission
    plan = await ai_agent.create_plan(task)

    # No visibility into what's happening
    for action in plan.actions:
        await action.execute()

    print("Task complete")
    # You have no idea what the agent did, no way to stop it,
    # and no way to undo it
```

**Why It Matters:** AI agents can take complex actions that affect multiple systems. Without visibility, approval points, and rollback capability, agents become black boxes that developers can't trust. Escape hatches make AI agents safe to use.

## Related Principles

- **[Principle #02 - Humans in the Driver Seat Always](02-humans-in-driver-seat.md)** - Escape hatches are the mechanism that keeps humans in control; they provide the technical implementation of human authority over AI decisions

- **[Principle #35 - Least-Privilege Automation with Scoped Permissions](../governance/35-audit-trails-always-on.md)** - Escape hatches need audit trails to show what was stopped, when, and by whom; audit logs provide the information needed to decide when to intervene

- **[Principle #41 - Adaptive Sandboxing with Explicit Approvals](../technology/41-graceful-degradation.md)** - Escape hatches are a form of graceful degradation; they allow systems to fall back to human control when automation encounters problems

- **[Principle #32 - Error Recovery Patterns Built In](../technology/32-error-recovery-patterns.md)** - Escape hatches enable error recovery by giving humans the ability to stop failing operations and trigger recovery procedures

- **[Principle #34 - Feature Flags as Deployment Strategy](../technology/34-monitoring-observability-first.md)** - Good monitoring helps humans know when to use escape hatches by surfacing problems early, before they become critical

- **[Principle #23 - Protected Self-Healing Kernel](../technology/23-protected-self-healing-kernel.md)** - Escape hatches protect the kernel by ensuring humans can stop self-healing operations that go wrong

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Escape Hatches That Don't Actually Stop**: Implementing "stop" buttons that set a flag but don't interrupt the current operation, leaving agents running for minutes after hitting stop.
   - Example: `if stop_flag: break` checked only at the end of a 5-minute operation
   - Impact: Users hit stop but see no effect, lose trust, and eventually kill the process forcefully, losing all progress

2. **Requiring Too Many Steps to Intervene**: Making humans navigate through menus, confirm dialogs, or wait for operations to reach "safe" stop points.
   - Example: "Click Settings ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Emergency Controls ‚Üí Are you sure? ‚Üí Wait for current batch to complete"
   - Impact: By the time a human navigates the UI, the AI has already caused significant damage

3. **No Dry Run or Preview Capability**: Requiring users to either trust the AI completely or not use it at all, with no way to see what would happen first.
   - Example: Deployment scripts that execute immediately without showing a plan
   - Impact: Users can't evaluate AI decisions before they take effect, leading to surprises and lost confidence

4. **Escape Hatches Only in Debug Mode**: Building stop mechanisms that are disabled in production or only available to administrators.
   - Example: Ctrl+C handling only works in development environment
   - Impact: When problems occur in production (where they matter most), operators have no way to intervene

5. **No State Visibility During Execution**: Running long operations with no progress indication, leaving humans unable to judge when intervention is needed.
   - Example: "Processing..." with no indication of what's being processed or how far along it is
   - Impact: Humans don't know if the operation is working correctly or stuck, can't make informed decisions about when to stop

6. **Irreversible Actions Without Confirmation**: Allowing AI agents to perform destructive operations without any human approval or even notification.
   - Example: Auto-deploying to production based on passing tests, with no human checkpoint
   - Impact: Small mistakes in test configuration or AI judgment lead to production outages

7. **Hidden Autonomy Settings**: Burying autonomy controls in configuration files or environment variables instead of making them easily adjustable.
   - Example: `AI_AUTONOMY_LEVEL` in `.env` file that developers don't know exists
   - Impact: Developers can't easily dial autonomy up or down based on task complexity, leading to either excessive interruptions or insufficient oversight
