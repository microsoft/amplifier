# Studio-Interface Project Archive

This directory contains design protocols and aesthetic guidance **specific to the Studio-Interface project**.

## Important Context

The Studio-Interface project was the reference implementation for the Amplified Design system. It demonstrates how to apply the Nine Dimensions and Five Pillars methodology to a specific project with its own aesthetic identity.

### Studio-Interface Dual Aesthetic

The Studio project uses **two distinct aesthetics** for different contexts:

1. **Homepage/Marketing** - Swedish Design Studio aesthetic
   - Playful, creative, inviting
   - Goal: "Come in and explore!"
   - Warm, colorful, interactive

2. **App/Workspace** - German Car Facility aesthetic
   - Clean, focused, precise
   - Goal: "Here's your focused space to create"
   - Restrained, purposeful, quality through subtle refinement

This dual-aesthetic approach shows how context shapes expression (Layer 4 of the methodology).

## What's Archived Here

These files were created during Studio-Interface development and contain project-specific aesthetic guidance:

- **PROACTIVE-DESIGN-PROTOCOL.md** - Detailed aesthetic guidance, color palettes, interaction principles
- **AGENT-VALIDATION.md** - Studio-specific agent validation scenarios
- **AGENT-TEST-SCENARIOS.md** - Test scenarios using Studio aesthetic
- **ACTIVE-studio-*.md** - Active Studio design work (archived after completion)
- **TODO-studio-*.md** - Studio work queue (archived after completion)

## How to Use This Archive

### For New Projects
**DO NOT copy these aesthetics directly.** Instead:
1. Study HOW the aesthetic framework was applied
2. Note the structure: emotional tone → color philosophy → interaction principles
3. Create your own `.design/AESTHETIC-GUIDE.md` for your project
4. Apply the Nine Dimensions to YOUR aesthetic

### For Understanding Methodology
These files demonstrate:
- Aesthetic-first implementation (design thinking before coding)
- Dual aesthetics for different contexts (homepage vs workspace)
- Quality standards (9.5/10 polish) independent of aesthetic choice
- How to document color palettes, timing, interactions

## Core System vs Project Aesthetics

**Core Amplified Design system files** (NOT in this archive):
- Provide frameworks for aesthetic establishment
- Teach HOW to apply Nine Dimensions to ANY aesthetic
- Define quality standards independent of aesthetic choice
- Located in: `amplifier/`, core `agents/`, `CLAUDE.md`, etc.

**Project-specific files** (IN this archive):
- Apply the framework to Studio-Interface's specific needs
- Document Studio's dual aesthetic choices
- Show concrete implementation of abstract principles
- Reference implementation for learning

## Key Learning: Separation of Concerns

The original mistake was allowing Studio's aesthetic to leak into core system files. This archive preserves Studio's aesthetic as an **example**, not a prescription.

New projects should:
1. Start with the core framework (Nine Dimensions, Five Pillars)
2. Define their own aesthetic identity
3. Document it in their own `.design/AESTHETIC-GUIDE.md`
4. Apply the framework to their choices

**Remember:** The artifact is the container. The experience is the product. The aesthetic is the expression. The framework is the foundation.
