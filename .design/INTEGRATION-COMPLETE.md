# Agent Integration Complete

**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: ✅ Complete - Ready for Testing

---

## What We Built

Based on the analysis in [AGENT-INTEGRATION-ANALYSIS.md](./AGENT-INTEGRATION-ANALYSIS.md), we've integrated the best parts of `requirements-architect` and `ux-wireframe-designer` into our Amplified Design system.

---

## New Files Created

### 1. Agent Files

#### [agents/requirements-architect-studio.md](../agents/requirements-architect-studio.md)
**Purpose**: Define, refine, and validate requirements for design features

**Key Improvements Over Original**:
- ✅ Aesthetic-first thinking (establishes emotional tone before functional specs)
- ✅ Nine Dimensions framework integrated
- ✅ Five Pillars validation built-in
- ✅ Swedish design studio vibe instead of generic software engineering
- ✅ Aesthetic acceptance criteria (timing, feel, feedback)
- ✅ Out of scope declarations
- ✅ Outputs to `.design/requirements/[feature-name].md`

**Usage**:
```
user: "I want to add a notification system"
assistant: Uses requirements-architect-studio to create requirements doc with:
- Purpose & Intent (Layer 1 validation)
- Nine Dimensions aesthetic requirements
- Acceptance criteria (functional AND aesthetic)
- Out of scope boundaries
```

---

#### [agents/ux-wireframe-designer-studio.md](../agents/ux-wireframe-designer-studio.md)
**Purpose**: Design user interfaces with aesthetic-first thinking

**Key Improvements Over Original**:
- ✅ Aesthetic brief BEFORE wireframes (emotional tone, palette, key interaction)
- ✅ Nine Dimensions planning built into workflow
- ✅ Swedish studio vibe standards (playful + refined)
- ✅ Complete interaction specs (hover, focus, active, loading, error, success, disabled)
- ✅ Motion timing standards (500ms deliberate, 150ms responsive)
- ✅ Color philosophy (reveal through interaction)
- ✅ Reduced motion fallbacks required
- ✅ Outputs to `.design/wireframes/[feature-name]-ux.md`

**Usage**:
```
user: "Design a palette switcher"
assistant: Uses ux-wireframe-designer-studio to create:
- Design brief (emotional goal, palette choice, magic moment)
- Mermaid user flow (all paths including errors)
- Component hierarchy with props
- Complete interaction specs for every state
- Responsive behavior (mobile, tablet, desktop)
```

---

### 2. Template Files

#### [.design/REQUIREMENTS-TEMPLATE.md](.design/REQUIREMENTS-TEMPLATE.md)
**Purpose**: Standardized format for feature requirements

**Structure**:
1. **Purpose & Intent** (Layer 1) - Should this exist? For whom? Values embodied?
2. **User Stories** - As a/I want/So that format
3. **Aesthetic Requirements** (Nine Dimensions) - Style, Motion, Voice, Space, Color, Typography, Proportion, Texture, Body
4. **Functional Requirements** - Core capabilities, edge cases, error scenarios
5. **Acceptance Criteria** (Given/When/Then) - Functional, Aesthetic, Accessibility
6. **Component Specifications** - Hierarchy, props, state management
7. **Non-Functional Requirements** - Performance, security, scalability
8. **Out of Scope** - What's NOT included and why
9. **Design Artifacts** - Links to wireframes, flows
10. **Validation Checklist** - Design system, aesthetic, accessibility, Five Pillars

**Example Usage**: Copy template to `.design/requirements/[your-feature].md` and fill in

---

#### [.design/WIREFRAME-STANDARDS.md](.design/WIREFRAME-STANDARDS.md)
**Purpose**: Define when and how to create design artifacts

**Key Sections**:
1. **Complexity Thresholds** - When to create wireframes (simple vs medium vs complex)
2. **Design Brief Template** - Required for ALL features (emotional tone, palette, key interaction)
3. **Mermaid User Flows** - Syntax and patterns for flow diagrams
4. **Wireframe Creation** - Tools (Mermaid, SVG, Figma) and annotation standards
5. **Component Hierarchy** - How to document React component nesting
6. **Interaction Specifications** - Template for every interactive element (all states)
7. **Responsive Design** - Documentation for mobile, tablet, desktop
8. **Accessibility** - ARIA, keyboard nav, screen readers, focus management
9. **Quality Checklist** - Verify before finalizing

**Example Usage**: Reference when creating wireframes for medium/complex features

## What's Different From Original Agents?

### requirements-architect → requirements-architect-studio

| Original | Studio Version |
|----------|----------------|
| Generic software engineering | Design-focused (Nine Dimensions, Five Pillars) |
| Functional requirements only | Aesthetic + functional requirements |
| No emotional/aesthetic thinking | Aesthetic-first (emotional tone, palette, interactions) |
| Generic acceptance criteria | Aesthetic acceptance criteria (timing, feel, feedback) |
| Outputs to `REQUIREMENTS.md` | Outputs to `.design/requirements/[feature].md` |
| No design system integration | Validates against globals.css, 8px system, WCAG AA |

### ux-wireframe-designer → ux-wireframe-designer-studio

| Original | Studio Version |
|----------|----------------|
| Function-first workflow | Aesthetic-first workflow (brief before wireframes) |
| Generic accessibility | Specific (44x44px targets, 4.5:1 contrast, ARIA labels) |
| No aesthetic standards | Swedish studio vibe, playful palettes, 500ms timing |
| Basic interaction states | Complete state coverage (hover, focus, active, loading, error, success, disabled) |
| Generic design principles | Nine Dimensions integrated, Five Pillars embodied |
| Shadcn/ui references | Our component system, globals.css tokens |
| Outputs to `[feature]-ux-design.md` | Outputs to `.design/wireframes/[feature]-ux.md` |

## How to Use (Workflow)

### For Simple Features (<3 components, linear flow)

**Example**: Adding a tooltip, changing button copy

```
1. Create Design Brief
   - Emotional tone
   - Palette/color approach
   - Key interaction

2. Implement directly
   - Reference COMPONENT-CREATION-PROTOCOL.md
   - Reference PROACTIVE-DESIGN-PROTOCOL.md

3. Validate
   - npm run validate:tokens
   - npx tsc --noEmit
```

**No requirements doc or wireframes needed** - design brief only.

---

### For Medium Features (2-4 components, simple branching)

**Example**: Settings panel, palette switcher, notification system

```
1. Use requirements-architect-studio agent
   - Creates .design/requirements/[feature].md
   - Includes aesthetic requirements (Nine Dimensions)
   - Defines acceptance criteria (functional + aesthetic)
   - Sets scope boundaries (out of scope)

2. Create lightweight design artifacts
   - Design brief (in requirements doc)
   - Simple Mermaid user flow
   - Component hierarchy diagram

3. Implement with aesthetic-first approach
   - Reference PROACTIVE-DESIGN-PROTOCOL.md
   - Polish built-in from first pass

4. Validate against acceptance criteria
   - Functional criteria pass
   - Aesthetic criteria pass (timing, feel, feedback)
   - Accessibility criteria pass (WCAG AA)
```

---

### For Complex Features (5+ components, multi-step flows)

**Example**: Discovery canvas, authentication system, dashboard

```
1. Use requirements-architect-studio agent
   - Creates comprehensive requirements doc
   - All Nine Dimensions addressed
   - Acceptance criteria detailed

2. Use ux-wireframe-designer-studio agent
   - Creates .design/wireframes/[feature]-ux.md
   - Aesthetic brief first (emotional tone, palette, magic moment)
   - Detailed Mermaid user flows (all paths)
   - Wireframes with aesthetic annotations
   - Component hierarchy + TypeScript props
   - Complete interaction specs (every state)
   - Responsive behavior (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - Accessibility documentation

3. Review artifacts with stakeholders
   - Get alignment on aesthetic brief
   - Validate user flows cover all paths
   - Confirm component architecture

4. Implement
   - Reference requirements doc for acceptance criteria
   - Reference wireframes for layout/interactions
   - Reference PROACTIVE-DESIGN-PROTOCOL.md for aesthetic standards

5. Test against acceptance criteria
   - Functional tests
   - Aesthetic validation (timing measured, feedback observed)
   - Accessibility audit (keyboard nav, screen readers, contrast)
```

## Integration with Existing System

### Files to Reference When Using New Agents

**Before Creating Requirements**:
- [FRAMEWORK.md](../FRAMEWORK.md) - Nine Dimensions + Four Layers
- [PHILOSOPHY.md](../PHILOSOPHY.md) - Five Pillars deep dive
- [PROACTIVE-DESIGN-PROTOCOL.md](./PROACTIVE-DESIGN-PROTOCOL.md) - Swedish studio aesthetic, color palettes, interaction principles

**During Implementation**:
- [COMPONENT-CREATION-PROTOCOL.md](./COMPONENT-CREATION-PROTOCOL.md) - Technical validation
- [globals.css](../studio-interface/app/globals.css) - All CSS variables
- [Icon component](../studio-interface/components/icons/Icon.tsx) - Icon system

**After Implementation**:
- [DESIGN-CHECKLIST.md](./DESIGN-CHECKLIST.md) - Pre-ship validation
- Run `npm run validate:tokens` - Ensure no undefined CSS variables
- Run `npx tsc --noEmit` - Ensure type safety

---

## What Problems This Solves

### Before Integration

❌ **Problem**: No structured requirements format
- Jump from idea → code without clarity
- Hard to validate "done"
- Scope creep common

❌ **Problem**: No pre-implementation design artifacts
- Discover architectural issues during implementation
- More refactoring needed
- Team alignment harder

❌ **Problem**: No aesthetic acceptance criteria
- "Feels slow" → But what's the target timing?
- "Needs polish" → But what specifically?
- "Not accessible" → But which standards?

❌ **Problem**: Functional-first workflow
- Build it → Then make it look nice
- Polish added as refinement
- Multiple iterations to reach 9.5/10

---

### After Integration

✅ **Solution**: Structured requirements documents
- Clear purpose, user stories, acceptance criteria
- Testable (functional AND aesthetic)
- Out of scope prevents creep

✅ **Solution**: Pre-implementation design artifacts
- Wireframes with aesthetic annotations
- User flows (all paths documented)
- Component hierarchy defined upfront
- Less refactoring, better architecture

✅ **Solution**: Aesthetic acceptance criteria
- "Button lifts 2px over 150ms with ease-out" (measurable)
- "Palette transitions in 500ms, all elements together" (testable)
- "4.5:1 contrast for all text" (verifiable)

✅ **Solution**: Aesthetic-first workflow
- Establish emotional tone BEFORE wireframes
- Polish built-in from first pass
- Reach 9.5/10 quality faster

## Next Steps

### 1. Test the Templates (Week 1)
Pick 1-2 features to try the new workflow:

**Option A - Simple Feature**:
- Feature: [Add a new button variant]
- Use: Design brief only
- Outcome: Validate brief template is useful

**Option B - Medium Feature**:
- Feature: [Settings panel or filter component]
- Use: requirements-architect-studio agent + lightweight wireframes
- Outcome: Validate requirements template + simple flows

**Option C - Complex Feature**:
- Feature: [Multi-step wizard or dashboard]
- Use: Both agents (requirements + wireframes)
- Outcome: Validate full workflow

### 2. Gather Feedback (Week 2)
After testing:
- What worked well?
- What felt like bureaucracy?
- What's missing?
- What should be simplified?

### 3. Iterate Templates (Week 2-3)
Based on feedback:
- Simplify sections that are too heavy
- Add sections that are missing
- Clarify confusing parts
- Add more examples

### 4. Update CLAUDE.md (Week 3)
Once templates are validated, update main docs:
- Add section on requirements workflow
- Add section on wireframe workflow
- Update complexity thresholds if needed

### 5. Train Team (Week 4)
- Share examples of completed requirements docs
- Share examples of wireframes
- Conduct walkthrough of workflow
- Answer questions

## Red Flags (Adjust If You See These)

❌ **Feels like bureaucracy** - Simplify templates, make optional for simple features
❌ **Slows down development** - Reduce required sections
❌ **Templates not being used** - Something doesn't fit workflow, investigate why
❌ **Wireframes add friction** - Clarify when they're needed (complex only)
❌ **Requirements docs become stale** - Not referenced during dev, find out why

## Remember

**The Goal**: Better outcomes, not more process

- Use templates when they add value
- Skip them when they don't
- Iterate based on what works in practice
- Focus on quality, not documentation for its own sake

**Aesthetic-first always**:
- Emotional tone before functional specs
- Polish built-in, not added later
- Nine Dimensions addressed from start
- 9.5/10 quality maintained

**Quality at creation beats debugging later.**

---

## Questions?

If something is unclear or needs adjustment:
1. Test it with a real feature first
2. Document what doesn't work
3. Propose specific improvements
4. Iterate the templates

This is a living system - it should evolve based on real use, not theoretical perfection.
