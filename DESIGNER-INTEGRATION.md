**Status:** âœ… Complete - Ready for Use
**Date:** 2025-10-17 (Updated: 2025-10-23)
**Integration Type:** Modular Agent Architecture

---

## Overview

The Amplified Design system is now fully integrated with Amplifier's agent architecture, providing specialized design agents and a `/designer` slash command for design system work.

## What Was Built

### ðŸŽ¨ Three Specialized Design Agents

#### 1. **design-system-architect**
- **Location:** `.claude/agents/design-system-architect.md`
- **Purpose:** Strategic design system oversight
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Design token architecture
  - System-wide patterns and foundations
  - Nine Dimensions evaluation
  - Five Pillars validation
  - Cross-cutting design concerns

**When to use:**
```
Use the design-system-architect agent to create a semantic color system
```

#### 2. **component-designer**
- **Location:** `.claude/agents/component-designer.md`
- **Purpose:** Tactical component design
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Individual component design and refinement
  - Props API design
  - State handling (loading, error, empty, success)
  - Variant creation
  - Component documentation

**When to use:**
```
Use the component-designer agent to design a notification toast component
```

#### 3. **animation-choreographer**
- **Location:** `.claude/agents/animation-choreographer.md`
- **Purpose:** Motion design specialist
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Animation timing and easing
  - Micro-interactions
  - Page transitions
  - Loading states
  - Accessibility for motion

**When to use:**
```
Use the animation-choreographer agent to create a drawer slide-in animation
```

### âš¡ `/designer` Slash Command

- **Location:** `.claude/commands/designer.md`
- **Purpose:** Orchestrate design workflow
- **Modes:**
  - `/designer` - Auto-routes to appropriate agent
  - `/designer system [task]` - Direct to design-system-architect
  - `/designer component [task]` - Direct to component-designer
  - `/designer animate [task]` - Direct to animation-choreographer

## Integration Architecture

### Directory Structure

**Updated 2025-10-23:** Design agents now live in project `.claude/` directory (no longer symlinked to amplifier).

```

### How Integration Works

1. **Agent Discovery**
   - Design agents live in `amplified-design/.claude/agents/` (project-specific)
   - Amplifier agents live in `amplifier/.claude/agents/` (general-purpose)
   - Claude Code discovers agents from project `.claude/` directory
   - Amplifier agents accessible via explicit reference or path
   - Available via Task tool or direct invocation

2. **Command Routing**
   - `/designer` command expands from `.claude/commands/designer.md`
   - Routes to appropriate design agent based on task
   - Provides full context and philosophy

3. **Philosophy Preservation**
   - All agents reference Amplified Design's core documents
   - Nine Dimensions and Five Pillars embedded in agent prompts
   - 9.5/10 quality baseline maintained
   - Project aesthetic enforced (see `.design/AESTHETIC-GUIDE.md`)

4. **Modular Separation**
   - Design agents: amplified-design (this project)
   - General-purpose agents: amplifier (submodule)
   - Clear ownership boundaries
   - No cross-contamination

## Usage Guide

### Basic Usage

**Automatic routing (recommended):**
```bash
/designer Create motion timing tokens for micro-interactions
```
The system analyzes your request and routes to the appropriate agent.

**Direct routing:**
```bash
/designer system Define semantic color tokens for dark mode
/designer component Design a file upload component with drag-and-drop
/designer animate Create a success checkmark draw-in animation
```

### Integration with Other Agents

Design agents work seamlessly with amplifier's ecosystem:

**Workflow Example:**
```
1. /designer component Design a modal dialog
   â†’ component-designer creates specification

2. Use the modular-builder agent to implement the modal from the spec
   â†’ modular-builder codes the component

3. Use the security-guardian agent to validate accessibility
   â†’ security-guardian checks WCAG compliance

4. Use the test-coverage agent to ensure quality
   â†’ test-coverage writes tests
```

**Common Patterns:**

| Design Task | Agent Flow |
|-------------|------------|
| New component | designer â†’ modular-builder â†’ test-coverage |
| Animation | designer â†’ animation-choreographer â†’ performance-optimizer |
| System tokens | designer â†’ design-system-architect â†’ modular-builder |
| Accessibility fix | security-guardian â†’ designer â†’ modular-builder |
| Performance issue | performance-optimizer â†’ designer â†’ modular-builder |

### Philosophy Application

All design agents automatically apply:

#### Nine Dimensions
1. **Style** - German car facility aesthetic
2. **Motion** - <100ms instant, 100-300ms responsive, 300-1000ms deliberate
3. **Voice** - Clear, concise, purposeful
4. **Space** - 8px system (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128)
5. **Color** - WCAG AA contrast (4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI)
6. **Typography** - Sora, Geist Sans, Geist Mono
7. **Proportion** - Balanced scale relationships
8. **Texture** - Purposeful depth
9. **Body** - 44x44px touch targets, keyboard navigation

#### Five Pillars
1. **Purpose Drives Execution** - Understand why before how
2. **Craft Embeds Care** - Quality in details
3. **Constraints Enable Creativity** - Structure unlocks solutions
4. **Intentional Incompleteness** - Room for contribution
5. **Design for Humans** - People, not pixels

#### Quality Standards
- 9.5/10 baseline (refined, not generic)
- WCAG AA accessibility
- 60fps performance
- Reduced motion support
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Examples

### Example 1: Design System Token Architecture

```
/designer system Create animation timing tokens that align with our motion protocol

â†’ Routed to: design-system-architect
â†’ Applies: Motion timing protocol, Nine Dimensions (Motion)
â†’ Output: CSS variable definitions, usage guidelines, documentation
â†’ Next step: modular-builder implements in globals.css
```

### Example 2: Component Design

```
/designer component Design a toast notification with success, error, and warning variants

â†’ Routed to: component-designer
â†’ Applies: All Nine Dimensions, Five Pillars, state handling
â†’ Output: Component specification, props API, variant designs
â†’ Next step: modular-builder implements component
```

### Example 3: Animation Design

```
/designer animate Create a page transition that feels smooth and maintains context

â†’ Routed to: animation-choreographer
â†’ Applies: Motion timing protocol, GPU acceleration, reduced motion
â†’ Output: Animation specification, timing details, accessibility fallbacks
â†’ Next step: modular-builder implements with Framer Motion
```

### Example 4: Multi-Agent Workflow

```
User: "I need an animated icon for file upload"

1. /designer animate Design an upload icon animation
   â†’ animation-choreographer: Creates motion spec (arrow bounce, 300ms)

2. Use the modular-builder agent to implement the AnimatedUploadIcon
   â†’ modular-builder: Codes the component using Framer Motion

3. Use the test-coverage agent to test the animation
   â†’ test-coverage: Writes tests for animation states

4. Use the design-system-architect agent to review for consistency
   â†’ design-system-architect: Validates against system patterns

Result: Fully implemented, tested, system-consistent animated icon
```

## Key Reference Documents

Design agents automatically reference:

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found

**Issue:** `/designer` command doesn't appear

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify file exists
ls .claude/commands/designer.md

# Check if .claude is a symlink to amplifier/.claude
ls -la .claude

# Restart Claude Code if needed
```

### Agent Not Routing Correctly

**Issue:** Wrong agent selected for task

**Solution:**
Use direct routing:
```bash
/designer system [task]      # Force design-system-architect
/designer component [task]   # Force component-designer
/designer animate [task]     # Force animation-choreographer
```

### Philosophy Not Applied

**Issue:** Responses don't reference Nine Dimensions or Five Pillars

**Solution:**
```bash
# Explicitly request philosophy application
/designer Apply the Nine Dimensions framework to [task]

# Or reference documents directly
Review @FRAMEWORK.md and then [task]
```

## Success Metrics

Integration succeeds when:
- âœ… Design agents accessible via Task tool
- âœ… `/designer` command works
- âœ… Auto-routing selects correct specialist
- âœ… Philosophy automatically applied
- âœ… Quality consistently at 9.5/10
