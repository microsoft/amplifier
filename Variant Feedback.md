Variant Feedback

Key Themes Across All Feedback

  Variant 11 is the clear winner:

  - Preferred by: Marc, David, Brian (among top 3), Sam
  - Strengths: Direct/brass tacks approach, clear task-oriented tabs, minimal fluff
  - Issues: "Evaluate for Team" tab unnecessary (David)

  Strong Secondary Options:

  - Variant 6: Interactive sandbox appeal (Brian likes if kept current, Alex appreciates
  hands-on, Sam finds intriguing)
  - Variant 9: Community/social angle (Brian in top 3, Alex notes appeal for peer
  guidance)
  - Variant 10: (Brian in top 3)

  Least Effective:

  - Variant 6: Marc doesn't believe in hosting interactively
  - Variant 7: Too busy/animations (Marc), needs max-width constraint (Brian)
  - Variant 8: Feels like a learning module sub-experience (Brian)
  - Variant 10 & 11: Alex found these least effective (vague value prop, decision
  overload)

  Critical Feedback from Paul:

  None of them worked for him - this is important:
  - Beautiful but disconnected marketing speak
  - Overstated promises ("assistants" vs task runners)
  - Missing practical information (Claude Code costs, real prerequisites)
  - Floating graphs pointless
  - Unfocused - seems like 3-4 different purposes hallucinated together

  What Paul wants:
  - Videos of real use cases with transcripts/guides to follow along
  - Either full GUI (no CLI mentions) OR familiar dev tool site (like uv, nodejs)
  - Real connection to today's reality, not future vision

  Actionable Synthesis

  Recommended Approach:

  1. Start with Variant 11's structure (task-oriented tabs)
  2. Incorporate Paul's reality check:
    - Lead with actual installation/prerequisites
    - Use real language (not marketing speak)
    - Include cost information
    - Add video walkthroughs with transcripts
  3. Polish based on feedback:
    - Remove "Evaluate for Team" tab
    - Add variant numbering/labeling for feedback
    - Fix scroll issues in navigation
    - Consider Alex's IA suggestion (4 pillars: Marketing, Docs, Community, Learning)
