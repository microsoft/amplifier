# ðŸš€ Amplifier Quick Start Guide

**You're ready to run Amplifier!** The system is installed and working.

## âœ… What Just Worked

The demo just successfully:
1. âœ… Loaded the memory system
2. âœ… Created and stored memories
3. âœ… Performed semantic search using AI embeddings
4. âœ… Found relevant memories by meaning (not just keywords!)

You now have **8 example memories** stored in `.data/memory.json`.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Try These Commands Now

### 1. Run the Demo Again
```bash
python demo_amplifier.py
```

### 2. Explore Available Commands
```bash
make help
```

### 3. Start a Claude Code Session
```bash
# Make sure you're in the amplifier directory
cd /Users/max/Documents/GitHub/amplifier

# Start Claude Code (uses all Amplifier enhancements automatically)
claude
```

### 4. Use Amplifier on Your Own Projects
```bash
# Start Claude with both Amplifier and your project
claude --add-dir /path/to/your/project

# Then paste this as your first message:
# "I'm working in /path/to/your/project. Please cd there and work there.
#  Do NOT update any issues or PRs in the Amplifier repo."
```

## ðŸ§  What Makes Amplifier Special?

### **20+ Specialized AI Agents**

Instead of one general assistant, you get experts:

- `zen-architect` - System design and architecture
- `bug-hunter` - Find and fix bugs
- `security-guardian` - Security review and hardening
- `test-coverage` - Comprehensive testing strategies
- `refactor-architect` - Code improvement and refactoring

**Example usage in Claude:**
```
"Use the zen-architect agent to design my authentication system"
"Deploy bug-hunter to find why my API is slow"
```

### **Memory System** (What you just ran!)

The system remembers:
- **Preferences** - Your coding style, tool choices
- **Learnings** - API limits, framework quirks
- **Decisions** - Why you chose approach X over Y
- **Solutions** - How you solved tricky problems

### **Knowledge Synthesis**

Extract patterns from your documentation:

```bash
# Scan your docs/articles
make content-scan

# Extract knowledge
make knowledge-update

# Query what you've learned
make knowledge-query Q="What are the best practices for async?"
```

### **Parallel Worktrees**

Test multiple solutions simultaneously:

```bash
# Try two different approaches at once
make worktree feature-approach-a
make worktree feature-approach-b

# Compare and choose the winner
make worktree-list
make worktree-rm feature-approach-b  # Remove the one you don't want
```

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Path

### Beginner
1. âœ… Run `demo_amplifier.py` (you just did this!)
2. Start `claude` in this directory
3. Ask Claude: "Show me how the memory system works"

### Intermediate
1. Create a worktree: `make worktree experiment-1`
2. Use an agent: "Use zen-architect to plan feature X"
3. Query knowledge: `make knowledge-query Q="your question"`

### Advanced
1. Configure external data dir in `.env` (enables cloud backup)
2. Build knowledge graph: `make knowledge-graph-build`
3. Create custom agents (see `.claude/AGENTS_CATALOG.md`)

---

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

### Optional: Use Cloud Storage

Keep your knowledge across machines:

```bash
# Copy example config
cp .env.example .env

# Edit to use your cloud storage
# Example for macOS with iCloud:
AMPLIFIER_DATA_DIR=~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/amplifier/data
AMPLIFIER_CONTENT_DIRS=~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/amplifier/content
```

Benefits:
- âœ… Knowledge syncs across devices
- âœ… Automatic cloud backup
- âœ… Shared across all worktrees

## ðŸ’¡ Next Steps

### **Immediate** (next 5 minutes)
```bash
# Explore what the system can do
make help

# Start coding with AI assistance
claude
```

### **Today** (next hour)
1. Read the [full README](README.md)
2. Browse available [agents catalog](.claude/AGENTS_CATALOG.md)
3. Try using an agent on a real task

### **This Week**
1. Set up cloud storage for persistence
2. Extract knowledge from your docs: `make knowledge-update`
3. Create a worktree for an experiment

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Demo Shows Duplicate Memories?

That's normal! Each run adds new memories. To reset:
```bash
rm .data/memory.json
python demo_amplifier.py
```

### Can't Find a Command?

```bash
make help  # Shows ALL available commands
```

### Claude Code Not Finding Agents?

Make sure you're in the amplifier directory:
```bash
cd /Users/max/Documents/GitHub/amplifier
claude  # Agents auto-load from .claude/agents/
```
