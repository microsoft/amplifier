# Web API Demo Project

A simple REST API for a todo application with evolving requirements.

## Context

This project represents a typical web application where:
- Requirements are expected to evolve
- Rapid iteration is important
- Documentation should stay in sync with code
- Simplicity and maintainability matter

**Perfect for: `default` profile (Document-Driven Ruthless Minimalism)**

## Initial Requirements

Build a REST API for managing todo items with:
- Create todo
- List todos
- Mark todo as complete
- Delete todo

## Technology Stack

- Python with FastAPI
- SQLite database
- Pydantic models
- Pytest for testing

## Expected Evolution

Requirements will likely evolve to include:
- User authentication
- Todo categories/tags
- Due dates and reminders
- Sharing todos between users

This is a perfect use case for iterative, document-driven development where we build what's needed now and evolve based on real usage.
