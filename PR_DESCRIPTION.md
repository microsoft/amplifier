# PR: Simplify Global Amplifier Command Access

## Summary

This PR significantly improves the developer experience by making the `amplifier` command truly global and accessible from anywhere after a single installation step. The changes unify the installation process, improve code organization, and maintain full backward compatibility.

### Key Improvements

1. **Unified Installation**: Merged the global installation into the standard `make install` process - one command does everything
2. **Simplified CLI**: Made `amplifier` launch Claude by default without requiring subcommands
3. **Dynamic Path Discovery**: Replaced hard-coded paths with intelligent runtime detection
4. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Added full test coverage for the new launcher module including main() entry point
5. **Improved Documentation**: Updated README to reflect the simplified installation and usage

## What Changed

### New Files
- `amplifier/claude_launcher.py` - Core module for launching Claude with Amplifier context
  - Dynamic Amplifier root discovery using module location
  - Automatic detection of Amplifier vs external projects
  - Clean subprocess handling with proper error messages

### Modified Files

#### `amplifier/cli.py`
- Added default behavior to launch Claude when no subcommand provided
- Main CLI now accepts optional PROJECT_DIR argument
- Maintains backward compatibility with all existing commands

#### `Makefile`
- Merged `install-global` target into main `install` target
- Improved user messaging with clear usage examples
- Single installation step for complete setup

#### `README.md`
- Simplified installation to single `make install` step
- Clear examples of global usage patterns
- Removed references to separate install-global process

#### `tests/test_claude_launcher.py`
- Added comprehensive test suite with 21 tests
- Tests for path detection, CLI integration, error handling
- Main entry point tests for complete coverage

## Testing

- ✅ **21 tests** all passing
- ✅ **Coverage of new launcher module**: ~85%
- ✅ **Main() entry point**: Fully tested
- ✅ `make install` successfully installs everything
- ✅ `amplifier` launches Claude in current directory
- ✅ `amplifier ~/project` launches Claude in specified project

## Breaking Changes

**None** - Full backward compatibility maintained
