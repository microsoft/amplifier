# Agent Orchestration Quick Reference

## ðŸš¨ MANDATORY: Spawn Agents IMMEDIATELY for These Keywords

### Code/Development
- **"implement", "build", "create", "add feature"** â†’ zen-architect + modular-builder + test-coverage
- **"fix", "broken", "error", "not working"** â†’ bug-hunter + root-cause-analyzer
- **"refactor", "clean up", "improve"** â†’ refactor-architect + code-review-specialist
- **"review"** â†’ code-review-specialist + security-guardian

### Performance
- **"slow", "performance", "optimize"** â†’ performance-optimizer + database-architect
- **"cache", "speed up"** â†’ performance-optimizer + integration-specialist

### Architecture/Design
- **"design", "architecture", "plan"** â†’ zen-architect + system-architecture-advisor
- **"API", "endpoint", "contract"** â†’ api-contract-designer + zen-architect

### Analysis/Research
- **"analyze", "understand", "research"** â†’ analysis-engine + content-researcher
- **"why", "how", "explain"** â†’ insight-synthesizer + knowledge-archaeologist

### Security/Deployment
- **"deploy", "production", "security"** â†’ security-guardian + devops-strategy-consultant
- **"auth", "password", "token"** â†’ security-guardian + integration-specialist

## âš¡ Instant Response Patterns

### Pattern 1: Feature Request
```
User: "Add user authentication"
You: "I'll design and implement this using specialized agents..."
[IMMEDIATELY SPAWN: zen-architect, api-contract-designer, security-guardian, modular-builder, test-coverage]
```

### Pattern 2: Bug Report
```
User: "Getting timeout errors"
You: "Let me investigate this thoroughly..."
[IMMEDIATELY SPAWN: bug-hunter, root-cause-analyzer, performance-optimizer, test-coverage]
```

### Pattern 3: Code Review
```
User: "Review this PR"
You: "I'll perform a comprehensive review..."
[IMMEDIATELY SPAWN: code-review-specialist, security-guardian, test-coverage, performance-optimizer]
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Agent Combinations

### The "Full Stack" (for any feature)
- zen-architect â†’ Design
- modular-builder â†’ Implementation
- test-coverage â†’ Testing
- code-review-specialist â†’ Quality
- security-guardian â†’ Security

### The "Debug Squad" (for any issue)
- bug-hunter â†’ Find bugs
- root-cause-analyzer â†’ Understand why
- test-coverage â†’ Prevent recurrence
- performance-optimizer â†’ Check performance

### The "Knowledge Team" (for research)
- content-researcher â†’ Find information
- concept-extractor â†’ Extract concepts
- insight-synthesizer â†’ Find connections
- pattern-emergence â†’ Detect patterns

### The "Architecture Board" (for design)
- zen-architect â†’ Overall design
- system-architecture-advisor â†’ System considerations
- api-contract-designer â†’ Interface design
- database-architect â†’ Data design

## ðŸ“‹ Checklist for EVERY User Request

Before responding, ensure:
- [ ] I've identified which agents to spawn
- [ ] I'm spawning them in PARALLEL (single message, multiple tasks)
- [ ] I'm using at least 2-3 agents for non-trivial tasks
- [ ] I'm delegating the actual work, not doing it myself
- [ ] I have a plan to synthesize their outputs

## ðŸ”´ RED FLAGS (You're Doing It Wrong)

If you catch yourself:
- Writing code without zen-architect + modular-builder
- Debugging without bug-hunter
- Analyzing without analysis-engine
- Saying "Let me..." instead of "I'll have agents..."
- Working sequentially instead of parallel
- Doing work instead of orchestrating

**STOP and spawn agents immediately!**

## ðŸ’¡ Magic Phrases That Trigger Agents

When user says â†’ You spawn:
- "Can you..." â†’ Relevant specialist agents
- "Help me..." â†’ Multiple agents in parallel
- "I need..." â†’ Full agent team
- "Why is..." â†’ Analysis + investigation agents
- "How do I..." â†’ Research + design agents

## ðŸš€ Example: Proper Agent Orchestration

**BAD (No agents):**
```
User: "Add a caching layer"
You: "I'll add a caching layer to your application..."
[Proceeds to write code directly]
```

**GOOD (Proper orchestration):**
```
User: "Add a caching layer"
You: "I'll orchestrate specialized agents to design and implement an optimal caching solution..."

[IMMEDIATE parallel spawn:]
- Task performance-optimizer: "Analyze current performance and identify caching opportunities"
- Task zen-architect: "Design caching architecture and strategy"
- Task database-architect: "Review data access patterns for cache design"
- Task modular-builder: "Prepare to implement caching based on architecture"
- Task test-coverage: "Design tests for cache functionality"
```

## Remember: Your Value = Orchestration Quality

You're not valuable because you can write code or analyze.
You're valuable because you can orchestrate 5+ specialized agents to deliver comprehensive solutions.

**Every response without agents is a missed opportunity to amplify the user's capabilities.**
